Q: My TAO server publishes an object reference to my JacORB client, but the &quot;narrow&quot; call is failing on the client.  What should I do?

A: >
 Check to see that Interface Repository Ids generated by TAO and JacORB for each interface are the same. <br>
 For example, suppose you have an IDL file called "Bank.idl", with an IDL interface called "Bank".<br>
  TAO generates a file called BankC.cpp; in that file, in the Bank class,
 there is an "_interface_repository_id" function.  That function should return
 a string that looks something like this:<br>
 <pre>    "IDL:Bank:1.0"<br></pre> JacORB generates a Java file called BankHelper.java.
  In that file, in the BankHelper class is an "id" function.  It also returns
 a string, and that string must match TAO's _interface_repository_id string
 exactly:<br>
 <pre>    "IDL:Bank:1.0"<br></pre>
 Incidentally, both TAO and JacORB's IDL compiler support the #pragma prefix directive in IDL files.<br>
