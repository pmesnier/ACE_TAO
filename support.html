    <span class="bodytext"><br />

      <p>The Data Local Reconstruction Layer (DLRL) is very
        attractive and we expect developers to require it in
        future versions of OpenDDS.  While OCI has developed a
        comprehensive implementation of DLRL, in Java and C++, it
        is not available under an open source model.</p>

      <p>We also anticipate using the extensible transport framework (ETF) to provide additional transports,
        for different industry segments, and potentially a &ldquo;DDS to Pub/Sub Gateway&rdquo; to accommodate
        the many legacy systems&rsquo; protocols.</p>

      <p>Along with Gateways we expect to develop migration strategies for those clients who wish to consolidate
        their pub/sub infrastructure into a standards-based, open source framework.</p>

      <p>Communicating securely over real-time,
        deadline-scheduled, publish-subscribe middleware is
        challenging.  A security management framework for OpenDDS
        is planned that supports authentication, data integrity,
        key management (symmetric and asymmetric), and
        non-repudiation.  The framework would enable users of
        OpenDDS to configure their own encryption and hashing
        algorithms and other security aspects.  The implementation
        of this framework will not conflict with International
        Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR); encryption strength
        and the implementation thereof is still the responsibility
        of the end user in consonance with local laws.  The goal
        is to minimize the impact of the additional security
        capabilities on the performance and predictability of the
        data communication and to integrate the new capabilities
        into the existing overall OpenDDS architecture.  Funding
        is needed to implement the security management framework
        for OpenDDS.</p>
