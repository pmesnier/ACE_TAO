Q: Why doesn't using the Naming Service with Multicast work?

A: At least
on some versions of Windows, there's a bug in which the TTL (Time-to-Live) field in multicast
IP packets is set to zero.  Thus, nobody pays attention to those packets.
 This particular problem bit OCI in their training lab environment, and for
this reason we now use the Naming Service without multicasting as documented
in the TAO Developer's Guide (see LINK:004:).

The problem is documented in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q234/9/80.ASP">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q234/9/80.ASP</a>.  Although the notes say to get the latest Service Pack, our experience shows that this doesn't help as of Service Pack 6.
