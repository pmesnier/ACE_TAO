Q: How can I get TAO to use a transport protocol other than TCP/IP?

A: >
 TAO includes a "pluggable" transport protocol framework
 that allows the ORB to be configured to work over transports
 other than TCP/IP.  In fact, the standard Internet Inter-ORB
 Protocol (IIOP) is implemented in TAO as a pluggable transport
 protocol that is based on TCP/IP.  Besides IIOP, TAO comes
 with several alternate transport protocol implementations,
 including:
 
 <ul>
 <li>Unix Inter-ORB Protocol (UIOP), which is based on Unix Domain Sockets (or local IPC)</li>
 <li>Shared Memory Inter-ORB Protocol (SHMIOP), which uses shared memory as a transport.</li>
 <li>Datagram Inter-ORB Protocol (DIOP), which uses UDP for efficient message transfer in limited circumstances.</li>
 <li>Secure Sockets Layer Inter-ORB Protocol (SSLIOP), which is based on SSL.</li>
 <li>Multicast Inter-ORB Protocol (MIOP), implemented atop Unreliable IP Multicast (UIPMC).</li>
 <li>Hypertext Inter-ORB Protocol (HTIOP), which uses HTTP tunneling.</li>
 <li>Stream Control Transmission Protocol Inter-ORB Protocol (SCIOP), which is based on SCTP (IETF RFC 2960).</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>
 Currently, the UIOP, SHMIOP, DIOP, and SCIOP implementations
 are all found in <code>$TAO_ROOT/tao/Strategies/</code> and
 the TAO_Strategies library.  SSLIOP is implemented in the
 TAO_SSLIOP library in
 <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/</code>, MIOP/UIPMC in the
 TAO_PortableGroup library in
 <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/</code>, and
 HTIOP in the TAO_HTIOP library in
 <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/HTIOP/</code>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The use of the underlying transport protocol is completely
 transparent to the application.  In fact, the ORB can actually
 be configured to use more than one transport protocol
 simultaneously.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If one of the above built-in transport protocols does not meet
 your needs, you may need to implement one yourself.  If done
 correctly, it should require no changes to the TAO core.  Use
 one of the existing pluggable transport protocol
 implementations as guidance.

 Using and developing pluggable protocols is documented in
 detail in the <a href="http://www.theaceorb.com/purchase/index.html"><em>TAO Developer's Guide</em></a>.
