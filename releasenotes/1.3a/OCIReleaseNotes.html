									Heritage -- Relationship to DOC Releases
									<p>
										TAO 1.3a derives from the DOC TAO 1.3.1 beta kit with bugfix-related patches
										selectively applied to enhance stability. A record of applied patches can be
										found in <strong>OCIChangeLog</strong> files installed with the distribution.</p>
								<li>
									Make Project Creator
									<p>
									All of ACE/TAO was built using MakeProjectCreator (MPC). This tool is included
									with this distribution and may be used for your own projects as well. MPC will
									generate GNU make files, Windows project files for both VC++ 6 and 7.1, Borland
									make files, and others. It can be extended to other make systems as well. MPC
									documentation is available in the distribution at
									ACE_wrappers/bin/MakeProjectCreator/README or in the OCI Developer's Guide for
									TAO 1.3a. This chapter can be viewed from http://downloads.ociweb.com/MPC in
									html or downloaded in pdf.
									<p>
										Thus, all of the previous make files and project files, except for Visual Age
										project files (which do not yet have a MPC generator), have been removed and
										only generated files are present in this distribution.</p>
								<li>
									GNU Make on Unix
									<p>
										With the exception of Windows operating systems, ACE and TAO were built with
										GNU Make. While one can use other tools to build applications using ACE &amp;
										TAO, using GNU Make permits the leveraging of the existing build system
										distributed with ACE &amp; TAO.</p>
								<li>
									Compiler restrictions
									<p>
										Version 1.3a of ACE/TAO, being based on DOC TAO 1.3.1, requires that the
										compiler be able to support namespaces, at least minimally. Any compiler that
										does not support namespaces cannot be used with this version, for example,
										Sun's 4.2 compiler and Tornado 2.0.</p>
								<li>
									Explict template instantiation
									<p>
										It's possible, and maybe even desirable, to use explicit template instantiation
										for any platform. This can not only decrease compile times, but it helps
										prevent submitting errors in the explicit instantiation sections of source
										files. Just add "#define ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION" to config.h
										to enable this feature. A related setting for gcc, suncc, and others can be
										enabled by adding "templates=explicit" to platform_macros.GNU. This has the
										same effect as above, but additionally *requires* explicit instantiation. Since
										all current compilers support implicit templates, there is less need for this
										setting. However, this setting is still the default for suncc compilers,
										therefore you should probably add "templates=automatic" to your
										platform_macros.GNU for suncc. Currently there is an additional side-effect to
										enabling explicit template instantiation, regardless of which method you use to
										do it. It changes the default setting for TAO_USE_SEQUENCE_TEMPLATES, so that a
										non-template base class is used for all corba sequences. This means that you'll
										typically want to also add a "#define TAO_USE_SEQUENCE_TEMPLATES" to your
										config.h, whenever you add the "#define
										ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION".

							Many important new features and bug fixes have been introduced in TAO 1.3a.
							They are described briefly here. These and many other features of TAO 1.3a are
							detailed in OCI's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/product/index.html">TAO
								Developer's Guide, Version 1.3a</a>, available separately.
						</p>
						<ol type="1">
							<!--------------------------- PATCH 15 ------------------------->
							<li>
								<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p15</h3>
								<p></p>
								<ul>
									<!-- <li> <em>PUT YOUR p15 FEATURES HERE!</em></li> -->
									<li>
									Improved support for HP aCC compiler versions 3.57 and 3.60.
									</li>
									<li>
									Added emulated support for timed semaphore acquire() on HP-UX.
									</li>
									<li>
									Added a new dispatching strategy--Thread Per Consumer--to TAO's
									RT Event Service.  This strategy is similar to the MT dispatching
									strategy in that it separates the thread that receives the push()
									from a supplier from the thread that does the eventual push() to
									the consumer(s), but it differs from MT in that MT has a pool of
									threads pulling from a single queue and ultimately potentially
									servicing every consumer, whereas TPC has a queue for *each*
									consumer and, thus, a single thread is dedicated to pushing to that
									consumer.  This insures that a badly-behaved consumer CANNOT
									have an adverse effect on the channel or supplier.
									</li>
									<li>
									Added a means by which an application of the RT Event Service
									can specify what the RTEC should do if the TAO_EC_Queue fills up.
									This behavior is encapsulated in a derivation of an
									ACE_Service_Object, called TAO_EC_Queue_Full_Service_Object.
									The RTEC looks for a service object of a particular name (default
									in macro TAO_EC_DEFAULT_QUEUE_FULL_SERVICE_OBJECT_NAME).
									</li>
								</ul>
							<!--------------------------- PATCH 14 ------------------------->
							<li>
								<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p14</h3>
								<p></p>
								<ul>
									<!-- <li> <em>PUT YOUR p14 FEATURES HERE!</em></li> -->
									<li>
										Fixed "zombie" thread problem in the Notification Service where, when using
										<code>-AllocateTaskPerProxy</code> and a consumer terminates without properly
										disconnecting, the thread (i.e., task) becomes a "zombie" because no other
										thread does a proper join.  This results in the appearance of allocated-but-not-recovered
										resources until the thread ends.
									</li>
								</ul>
							<!--------------------------- PATCH 13 ------------------------->
							<li>
								<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p13</h3>
								<p></p>
								<ul>
									<!-- <li> <em>PUT YOUR p13 FEATURES HERE!</em></li> -->
									<li>
										Fixed a static initialization order dependency problem in ACE's Thread Specific
										Storage support.</li>
									<li>
										Added a <code>-x</code> option to <b>catior</b> that works like <code>-f</code>
										except that it reads the IOR from standard input rather than from a file. This
										makes catior much more like the unix "cat" command, and enables it to be used
										in a pipeline.</li>
									<LI>
										Changed the precedence rules for the <code>-ORBListenEndpoints</code> (aka <code>-ORBEndpoint</code>)
										so that the host identifier (either hostname or IP address) that appears in
										IIOP profiles is determined thus:
										<ol>
									<li>
										value from <code>hostname_in_ior</code>
									(if specified);
									<li>
										setting of <code>-ORBDottedDecimalAddresses</code>
									option;
									<li>
										value for <em>hostname</em> in <code>-ORBListenEndpoints</code>
									specification;
									<li>
							whatever TAO magically comes up with based on system configuration
						</ol>
						A new test (<code>TAO/tests/IOR_Endpoint_Hostnames</code>) verifies the
						operation of this feature. </LI>
						<li>
							Changed the way that Bidirectional endpoint processing happens when <code>-ORBDottedDecimalAddresses
								1</code> is in effect. The previous behavior always used the setting of the
							receiver, but that caused problems when the sender and receiver were not using
							the same dotted decimal addresses setting. Bidirectional endpoint processing
							now uses whatever the sender provides as the hostname since that's also what
							will be in that sender's IORs. See ChangeLog entry from<blockquote><code>Wed May 25
									12:10:40 2005 Chris Cleeland &lt;cleeland@ociweb.com&gt; </code></blockquote>
							for more details.
						</li>
						<li>
							Ported the -ORBPreferredInterfaces option from TAO 1.4 to allow specifying
							which local interface to use when connecting to a specified remote interface. <blockquote><code>
									-ORBPreferredInterfaces 192.168.*=127*,*.ociweb.com=132.* </code></blockquote>
							The above command causes TAO to use the first interface starting with 127 (e.g.
							127.0.0.1) when connecting to any address starting with 192.168.*, and to use
							the first interface starting with "132." when connecting to any host that ends
							in ociweb.com. T
							<br>
							The argument specified on the left side of the equals sign must match the
							target host, which usually comes from an IOR. For example, if an IOR contains
							test.theaceorb.com then this would not match either of the above directives,
							even if test.theaceorb.com happens to be at 192.168.1.10.
						</li>
						<li>
							The ACE Service Configurator now supports UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoding
							schemes when ACE_HAS_WCHAR is defined in config.h.
						</li>
						</ul>
						<!--------------------------- PATCH 12 ------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p12</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<!-- <li> <em>PUT YOUR p12 FEATURES HERE!</em></li> -->
								<li>
								The Service Configurator will now distinguish between the existence of and lack
								of file permissions for the default service configurator file.
								<li>
								The SO Reduce application was modified to generated MPC files instead of
								Makefiles.
								<li>
								The Visual Age 6 compiler configuration was changed to not use the #pragma
								implementation for templates. Instead, template header files just include the
								template cpp.
								<li>
								The IDL compiler now correctly handles UNC ("Universal Naming Convention")
								paths, when Windows-based projects used them in -I command line parameters or
								in #include statements.
								<li>
								Resolved and problem with tao_idl generated code for typedef-ed arrays, where
								some of the utility methods were not static as the CORBA spec requires.
								<li>
								Resolved a problem with generating the values for floating point constants in
								code generated by tao_idl
								<li>
								The gnuace MPC builds can now detect the presence of yacc(1) and/or lex(1) and
								regenerate all related parser code, based on the lexical analyzer and the
								grammar specifications ( idl.ll and idl.yy) On the platforms where these tools
								are not available, the pre-generated versions are used.
								<li>
								The SSLIOP transport protocol factory now correctly interprets Windows-style
								paths, which contain colon (':'), when pointing to the locations of keys and
								certificates.
								<li>
								Corrected a bug in the gnuace template that did not ensure that generated
								source files were created before attempting to generate the precompiled header
								binary.
								<li>
								The gnuace project type allows users to set the 'targetoutdir' template
								variable which determines where .obj, .shobj directories, binaries and
								libraries go.
								<li>
								The SO Reduce application now outputs MPC files instead of Makefiles.
								<li>
								The Service Configurator now distinguishes between the existence of a
								configurator file and the in-ability to open the configurator file.
								<li>
								Fixed a bug related to multicast federation of the RtEC. Removed the portion
								of code that attempts to subscribe to an existing multicast socket. This allows
								the ECG_MCast_EH to receive events on all supported platforms.
								<li>
								Improved interoperability with other ORBs with respect to use of Unicode based
								wide strings.
								<li>
								Fixed an SSLIOP bug related to sending large data sets.
								<li>
									Fixed several TSS bugs (mostly affect Windows builds):
									<ul>
										<li>
										Comply with POSIX standard for replacing a TSS object.
										<li>
										Comply with POSIX standard for deleting a key while it is in use.
										<li>
										Rework the ACE_TSS_Cleanup instance support to make it even safer.
										<li>
											Automatically cleanup TSS for non-ACE threads that call ACE functions.</li>
									</ul>
								<li>
								Fixed a problem affecting the ability of SSL-based TAO servers, which require
								client authentication to work with JSSE-based Java clients (JacORB).
								<li>
									Added new service configuration options to the SSLIOP_Factory:
									<ul>
										<li>
										-SSLCAFile FMT:file - allows explicit specification of the the Trusted
										Certificates location. The FMT is either "PEM" or "DER". Similar to verify(1)
										-CAfile option.
										<li>
										-SSLCAPath directory - allows explicit specification of the directory, where
										the Trusted Certificates are located. The directory must be in a particular
										format - see openssl(1) fom more details on how to install additional CA
										certificates. Similar to verify(1) -CApath option.
										<li>
											-SSLRand file1:file2:.. - allows specification of additional sources of
											randomness (entropy). The option mimics the -rand option on genrsa(1), for
											example.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						<!--------------------------- PATCH 11 ------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p11</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<!-- <li> <em>PUT YOUR p11 FEATURES HERE!</em></li> -->
								<li>
								Fixed a problem where an assertion would be thrown when a bi-directional POA
								policy has been used and then a different ORB instance is created. Note,
								however that the solution does not prevent some possible data race conditions
								for applications with multiple ORB instances, multiple threads that create them
								and using bi-directional POA policy.
								<li>
									Fixed a problem where, when using <code>-ORBConcurrency thread-per-connection</code>,
									connections to clients that have gone away result in sockets sitting in <code>CLOSE_WAIT</code>
								on the server side until the server exits.
								<li>
								A new ORB option was added, -ORBLingerTimeout, which only affects the IIOP
								transport. If a linger timeout is specified, it will be applied to each TCP
								socket prior to closing the connection.
								<li>
								Fixed a problem with premature connection closures on the server side, in cases
								where large replies were being subjected to the TCP flow control mechanism.
								<li>
								Modified the tao_idl code to correctly deal with typedef'ed arrays. When
								dealing with array's, detect if the array is typedef'ed. If it is typedef'ed
								and the primitive base type is a string, then it will generate code as if the
								array was typedef'ed to a string.
								<li>
								Added capability to use INS-style corbaloc references (e.g.,
								orbaloc:ssliop:localhost:12345/NameService) to specify SSLIOP references. This
								was motivated by a desire to access a naming service exclusively using SSLIOP,
								but needing to specify its endpoint to clients via a corbaloc-style IOR. See
								the new ssliop-corbaloc test in $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Security, which shows a
								typical usage of the new feature.
								<li>
								Updated TAO core to support both legacy URL style generated corbaloc IOR's
								(with escape character '\\') and OMG specified style (with escape character
								'%'). This makes it backward compatible with pre 1.4 TAO as well as other ORB's
								like JacORB etc.
								<li>
								Removed a bug workaround in ACE for 64-bit HP-UX. When specifying a base
								address for ACE_MMAP_Memory_Pool_Options (which is used by the mmap Naming
								Service persistence), it was previously ignored and a default value was used.
								This is no longer necessary for aCC versions later than 3.10.
								<li>
								Added configurator options for the CosEvent Service to determine the relative
								roundtrip timeout for both suppliers and consumers when pushing or pulling an
								event. An additional option was added to determine the number of retries (when
								pushing or pulling to or from an unresponsive consumer or supplier) before
								removing it from the CosEvent Service.
								<li>
									When built using the MPC-generated make/project files, the following common TAO
									utilities are now installed in the $ACE_ROOT/bin directory instead of the
									directories in which they are built:
									<ul>
										<li>
										tao_imr
										<li>
										tao_ifr
										<li>
										nslist
										<li>
										nsadd
										<li>
										nsdel
										<li>
											NamingViewer</li>
									</ul>
								<li>
									Fixed race conditions in calling destructors during Asynch Invocation by adding
									reference counting.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
						<!--------------------------- PATCH 10 -------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p10</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<!-- <li> <em>PUT YOUR p10 FEATURES HERE!</em></li> -->
								<li>
								Fixed a problem with codeset selection when the default wchar codeset is used
								and this is UTF-16. Now the UTF-16 BOM translator is selected even when the
								wchar codeset is defaulted.
								<li>
								Fixed memory leaks in the Notification Service that occurred when a Consumer
								disconnected.
								<li>
								There was a problem in the Notification Service's support for Event-style Admin
								and Proxy objects in addition to the one fixed in patch 9. This problem has
								been fixed, and the $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic test has been extended
								to further test support for Event-style objects.
								<li>
									The ORB distributed with the Java JDK 1.4.x has a defect in the code that
									marshals wide character strings in sequences of structures. As a work-around,
									TAO can now be forced to send all wide characters in big-endian order even on
									platforms like Intel x86 for which little-endian ordering is the default. The
									Byte Order Mark (BOM) is used as necessary to inform the peer ORB of the byte
									order being used. This work-around can be enabled either at compile time or at
									run time.
									<br>
									To configure it at compile time, define the symbol: TAO_USES_FORCE_UTF16BE.<br>
									To configure it at run time, use a new service configuration option:<br>
									<code>static UTF16_BOM_Factory "-forceBE [0|1]"</code><br>
									Zero turns it off; one turns it on.&nbsp; If neither zero nor one is specified,
									the state of the option is toggled.<br>
									There is a minor performance penalty for using this option so it should only be
									used if interoperability with the JDK ORB is needed.</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
						<!--------------------------- PATCH 9 -------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p9</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<!--
                <li>
                  <em>PUT YOUR p9 FEATURES HERE!</em></li>
-->
								<li>
								Fixed resource leak in Notification Service Connection Reliability (Topology)
								persistence that occurred when the *.new file could not be opened.
								<li>
								The Notification Service is supposed to support Event Service-style channels,
								but there was an error in the code that provided this support. The error
								resulted in a failure (usually a SEGV) when the first event was pushed to the
								old style channel. This has been corrected, and a test has been added to
								orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic that would have detected the problem.
								<li>
								The Notification Service XML Topology saver and loader were using ostream to
								save a CORBA::Long. This caused failures on some platforms, so the code was
								changed to copy the CORBA::Long to a long before it is saved.
								<li>
								The test in orbsvcs/tests/Notify/XML_Persistence was not honoring -ORB command
								line arguments.
								<li>
								The timeouts for the Basic and Reconnecting tests of the Notification Service
								were increased to accommodate slow platforms.
								<li>
								Added a perl version of the shell script to run one of the Notification Service
								performance tests (the graph 3-4 test). Also a usage message was added for this
								test.
								<li>
								The file orbsvcs/PSS/Dump_Visitor.cpp has been changed from using std ostreams
								to using ace/streams.h. The change was made to improve portability
								(particularly on HP-UX). The change was originally made in the DOC group
								repository.
								<li>
									Corrected several memory and resource leaks in the Naming Service, both in the
									library and in the executable. The most significant leaks were encountered when
									using flat file persistence (<font name="courier,fixed">-u</font> or <font name="courier,fixed">
										-r</font>
								options).
								<li>
								Corrected a minor memory leak in the core that would leak connection-related
								resources on connection closure or on shutdown.
								<li>
								Corrected a problem in the Notification Service where, when a consumer
								disappeared from the face of the earth, or at least the machine on which it was
								running, the notification service queued up events to deliver at a future time
								rather than considering the delivery to be a failure.
								<li>
									Fixed a linking problem (unresolved symbols) that affected gperf and other ACE
									applications. The <code>libadm</code>
								system library was missing from the link command line.
								<li>
								Fixed a problem where shared libraries didn't have the correct internal
								versioned name on platforms that support that (e.g., most Unix-like platforms).
								<li>
								Integrated a patch suggested in DOC Bugzilla #1542 that correctly deallocated
								items dynamically allocated and held in Thread-Specific Storage (TSS). This
								eliminates some long-standing pseudo-leaks such as the output_cdr_buffer, etc.
								<li>
								Corrected a problem in the NonBlocking_Conn_Test so that it works.
								<li>
									Updated the platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU file so that applications, when linked,
									will automatically look for libraries in <font face="courier">$ACE_ROOT/lib</font>.
								<li>
								Fixed a bug in the tao_idl compiler that caused link errors when array's were
								declared in the global scope. Particular helper functions were not exported and
								that doesn't work on Windows.
								<li>
								Added support for ACE_OS::fsync() under Windows, which calls FlushFileBuffers.
								Windows-specific code in the Notification Service that did this was therefore
								removed.
								<li>
								Added support for RedHat Advanced Server 3.0 running on the Opteron chip set.
								<li>
									Added support for an option in nsadd to add a new context, including the
									automatic addition of intermediate contexts for any addition.
									<p>
										This added capability is working correctly. However, the new test added to
										verify it has exposed a problem that has been in the Naming Service for a long
										time. The problem occurs only on static builds and only on some platforms. It
										is that only the first client can add a context, subsequent clients quietly
										fail when trying to add contexts, but they can add objects to existing
										contexts.
									</p>
								<li>
								Improved support for Winsock 2 on MS Pocket PC 2003 (WinCE 4.0). Automatic
								interface discovery now works correctly.
								<li>
									Added new test case for wide string interoperability, added procedure for
									building $TAO_ROOT/interop-tests/wchar for Sun's Java ORB as well as JacORB.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
						<!--------------------------- PATCH 8 -------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p8</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A new wait strategy--<em>Wait_On_LF_NoUpcalls</em>, specified with <code>"-ORBClientConnectionHandler
										mt_noupcall"</code>--was added to allow a thread that's waiting for a reply
									on an invocation to participate in the Leader-Follower interaction, but not
									dispatch upcalls on that thread (other threads are permitted to dispatch
									upcalls). This could be considered to be something between the two extremes of <em>
										Wait_On_Leader_Follower</em> (the default) and <em>Wait_On_Read</em> (specified
									with <code>"-ORBClientConnectionHandler rw"</code>), and could be reasonable
									alternative in many cases to <em>Wait_On_Read</em>.
								<li>
									<b>
										<blink>CODE CHANGES REQUIRED IN PLUGGABLE TRANSPORTS!</blink></b> The new <em>Wait_On_LF_NoUpcalls</em>
									wait strategy required minor changes to some of the base class code used in
									pluggable transports/pluggable protocols. The good news is that these changes
									are simple, actually reducing code in the pluggable transport.
									<p>
										The changes are in <code>TAO_Connection_Handler</code>. Using <code>TAO_IIOP_Connection_Handler</code>
										as an example (it's a pluggable transport just like anything else), the
										following code: <blockquote>
											<pre>
// OLD handle_input
int
TAO_IIOP_Connection_Handler::handle_input (ACE_HANDLE h)
{
  int result =
    this-&gt;handle_input_eh (h, this);

  if (result == -1)
    {
      this-&gt;close_connection ();
      return 0;
    }

  return result;
}
</pre>
										</blockquote>turns into <blockquote>
											<pre>
// New and improved handle_input
int
TAO_IIOP_Connection_Handler::handle_input (ACE_HANDLE h)
{
  return this-&gt;handle_input_eh (h, this);
}
</pre>
										</blockquote>The pluggable transport's <code>handle_input</code>
									no longer needs to close the connection.
									<p>
										However, if your pluggable transport's <code>handle_input</code> <em>doesn't</em>
										look like the old <code>handle_input</code>, you will need to look at <code>TAO_Connection_Handler::handle_input_eh()</code>
										and integrate the code that appears at the beginning of that method, i.e., <blockquote>
											<pre>
{
  if (this-&gt;transport ()-&gt;acts_as_server () &amp;&amp;
      this-&gt;orb_core_-&gt;get_tss_resources()-&gt;upcalls_temporarily_suspended_on_this_thread_)
    {

								<li>
									The Client_Strategy_Factory option <code>-ORBClientConnectionHandler</code> has
									been renamed to <code>-ORBWaitStrategy</code> to harmonize it more closely with
									the underlying components that implement it. The original name is still
									accepted for backwards compatibility, but <code>-ORBWaitStrategy</code>
								is suggested moving forward.
								<li>
								The Notification Service XML Topology Persistence object would stop prematurely
								on some 64 bit platforms. The resulting incomplete topology file would cause
								the notification service either to hang the next time it ran, or to restore
								only part of the topology. The topology file will now be written correctly.
								<li>
								Fixed a memory management issue in the IDL compiler that could cause it to
								crash with a segmentation violation on Tru64 4.0F with the Digital C++ v6.1-027
								compiler.
								<li>
								Fixed a bug in the IDL compiler where *I.{h,cpp} would not be generated when
								the -GI option was used.
								<li>
								Added support for the native long long type on VxWorks 5.42 or higher.
								<li>
								Added support for the wchar_t type on VxWorks 5.5 or higher.
								<li>
								Added a feature to the Naming_Service executable whereby it properly shuts
								itself down on receipt of a signal on platforms which support signals. It
								responds to SIGINT and SIGTERM.
								<li>
								Added support for building on PocketPC 2003 using eVC++ 4.0. This includes many
								wide-string adaptations of error/debug messages. TAO-specific RTEC gained
								configurable pacing delay to allow federation via multicast to work on PocketPC
								2003.
								<li>
									Added support for building on AMD 64-bit Athlon processors.

							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p7</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Several Bugs with the ImR have been fixed, although there are still known
								problems with PER_CLIENT activation, apparent memory leaks, and performance.
								Several new tests have been added to help track down these problems, and they
								may be addressed in a future release.
								<li>
								MPC is now a logically separate project. Most generic MPC tools have been moved
								to ACE_wrappers/MPC, although some ACE/TAO-specific extensions are still in
								ACE_wrappers/bin/MakeProjectCreator. Several bug fixes have been made, as well
								as some pretty significant performance improvements. The latest version of MPC
								is currently kept in the doc group CVS repository, but will be copied into the
								ACE_wrappers directory for any OCI release.
								<li>
								There is also a new clone_build_tree.pl script that can be used in place of
								create_ace_build.pl. The new script is much faster, has more features, and can
								output the cloned tree to any location, although it still defaults to
								ACE_wrappers/build. This tool is now part of the MPC suite of tools found in
								the MPC directory.
								<li>
									The Notification Service has been extended to support the ConnectionReliability
									and EventReliability properties defined in the CORBA standard. If these
									properties are given the value "persistent" the Notification service will store
									information about connection to clients and undelivered events in persistent
									storage. This information will be used to recover after a failure.<br>
									To take advantage of the reliable Notification Service the application
									developer must set the properties and cooperate during the reconnection
									process. Also he system administrator must configure the the notification
									service for persistent operation.<br>
									For more information see the CORBA standard available from <a href="http://www.omg.org">
										the OMG</a> and the document <a href="TAO/docs/notification/reliability.html">Using
										the Reliable Notification Service.</a>
								<li>
								In addition to the changes made directly to the Notification Service a number
								of test and example programs have been created for the reliable notification
								service. These programs may be found in subdirectories of
								$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Notify. A README file in each directory provides more
								detailed information, and a run_test.pl script is included to run the example
								or test.
								<li>
								A change has been made to the Notification Service IDL that significantly
								improved build times and reduced the Notification Service footprint. The change
								suppressed the generation proxy and stub code for the many interfaces that are
								specified by the OMG, but are not implemented in TAO.
								<li>
								Precompiled header support was added for the Tru64 compiler and the MIPSpro
								Compiler on IRIX.
								<li>
									Changed ACE to attempt to use gethostname() on Windows, if available, before
									falling back on GetComputerName() to implement ACE_OS::hostname. The
									GetComputerName() function returns the NetBios name, not the IP hostname.
									Often, they are identical, but this change should ensure that ACE/TAO will work
									even when the two names differ.
								</li>
							</ul>

						<!--------------------------- PATCH 6 -------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p6</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Changes were made to the IDL compiler to correct a problem where include paths
								added with the -I option were not being properly handled. This work was adapted
								from the DOC group's current IDL compiler which does not exhibit this problem.
								<li>
								Updated the config files for vc6 and vc7 to reflect the actual state of the
								compiler features used in ACE and TAO.
								<li>
								An MPC bug was fixed where relative directory replacement wouldn't take place
								when the replacement variable contained subdirectories underneath the current
								working directory.
								<li>
								Added support for Portable Interceptors to work with collocated invocations as
								well as remote invocations.
								<li>
								Made changes to fix crashing with the IDL compiler after adding support for
								correct include paths.
								<li>
								Refactored the ImR to move most functionality from the activator into the
								locator.
								<li>
									Fixed a bug in the ORB where activating objects on multiple RT ORB's would
									cause a segmentation fault.</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
						<!--------------------------- PATCH 5 -------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p5</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Assignments within 'specific' sections of mpc files are now handled correctly.
								Previously they were always handled as string additions.
								<li>
								Limited Support of GCC 3.3 on AIX has been added. Support for automatic
								template instantiation (except for the ACE_Singleton and TAO_Singleton) has
								been added. Singleton templates require explicit instantiation. The singleton
								templates can have problems (Segmentation Violations) when compiled with the
								optimize flag (-O)
								<li>
								Corrected code in the Implementation Repository's Activator (ImR_Activator)
								that made incorrect assumptions about which conditions could cause a TRANSIENT
								to be raised. This resulted in an inability of the activator to detect death of
								a server, and restart it.
								<li>
								Refactored GNU Makefile templates to support library versioning via MPC. The
								ACE and TAO version numbers are now supplied through the
								MakeProjectCreator/config/aceversion.mpb and taoversion.mpb files. These
								version numbers may be overridden by supplying a new value for 'version' in
								your project. If your project depends on ace or tao, and you wish to have no
								version applied, use 'version=' with no value to override.
								<li>
									Improved thread safety in the parsing of corbaloc endpoints.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
						<!--------------------------- PATCH 4 -------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p4</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Wide character support and interoperability has been improved. The UTF16
								handling code has been fixed to handle the byte order marker.
								<li>
								A fix for two threads allowed to handle_input for same handle at the same time
								has been added.
								<li>
								Fixed bug in Notification Service's EventChannelFactory::get_all_channels()
								that always returned an empty sequence.
								<li>
									Updates have been added to wxNamingViewer.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
						<!--------------------------- PATCH 3 -------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p3</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Tutorials: TAO/docs/tutorials has been updated and builds on multiple
								platforms. These tutorials may not execute on all systems and may have trouble
								building on static and exceptions=0 builds.
								<li>
								fixed bug 1614 - Possible crashes due to bad code in
								send_connection_closed_notifications_i().
								<li>
									corbaloc parser changes: The code responsible for parsing corbaloc style object
									references is refactored to enable the use of novel protocols in the address
									definition. This new feature enables protocols not shipped as part of TAO to be
									used with corbaloc or corbaname strings for resolving remote addresses.<br>
									To support this feature, a new virtual method is added to the base class
									TAO_Connector, corbaloc_scan(). The signature of the method may be found in
									$TAO_ROOT/tao/Transport_Connector.h:<br>
									<pre>  virtual TAO_Profile * corbaloc_scan (const char *ior,
                                       size_t &amp;len
                                       ACE_ENV_ARG_DECL);
</pre>
									This method is responsible for locating the end of the protocol specific
									address, returning a partially completed profile (the object key will be filled
									in later) and returning the length of the scanned address as the out parameter
									"len." The default implementation assumes that comma (',') and slash ('/') will
									not appear in the address, and will use the contents of the ior string upto the
									next comma or slash to populate the profile. If commas or slashes are valid
									parts of your protocol's address, as they are with Unix domain sockets (see
									UIOP), then you must supply your own implementation of corbaloc_scan to find a
									protocol specific address terminator. In such a case, the protocol specific
									address terminator will still be followed by a comma or slash, as required by
									the CORBA spec.<br>
									To maintain backwards compatibility with earlier TAO implementations, the UIOP
									implementation of corbaloc_scan will accept strings that end with a pipe ('|')
									that is not followed by a comma or slash. In this case, the remainder of the
									string is treated as the object key and a warning is generated.
									<br>
								<li>
									A new header file $ACE_ROOT/ace/Codeset_Symbols.h defines symbolic names for
									all of the code sets defined in OpenGroup's code set registry database version
									1.2g ( ftp://ftp.opengroup.org/pub/code_set_registry/ )<br>
									Three new symbols are defined to allow compile-time configuration of native
									code sets.<br>
									ACE_NATIVE_CHAR_CODESET_ID defines the native codeset used for 8 bit
									characters.<br>
									ACE_NATIVE_WCHAR_CODESET_ID defines the native codeset used for wide
									characters.<br>
									ACE_NATIVE_WCHAR_SIZE defines the width of a typical (not escaped or surrogated
									) code point in the native wide character code set.<br>
									The symbols can be defined in $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h. If they are not defined
									there, the following default values are used:<br>
									<pre>
    # define ACE_NATIVE_CHAR_CODESET_ID ACE_CODESET_ID_ISO_8859_1
    # define ACE_NATIVE_WCHAR_CODESET_ID ACE_CODESET_ID_ISO_UTF_16
    # define ACE_NATIVE_WCHAR_SIZE 2
</pre>
									These default values are the ones that were previously hard coded into TAO.<br>
									Note: ISO 8859_1 is also known as Latin-1 and ISO_UTF_16 is a version of
									Unicode.<br>
									The UCS4 to UTF16 character translator in
									$TAO_ROOT/tests/CodeSets/libs/UCS4_UTF16 has been extended to honor the Byte
									Order Marks (BOM) allowed (but not required) in GIOP 1.2 and to use and honor
									UTF-16 surrogate characters. Note that UTF-16 surrogate characters are an escape
									mechanism that allow characters wider than 16 bits to be represented in UTF-16.

						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p2</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Thread Specific Storage has been fixed for VxWorks 5.5 The VxWorks 5.5 loader
								has a strange quirk where complex static objects could be constructed multiple
								times during static construction and normal thread execution.
								<li>
								The ACE_Log_Msg has been fixed for using SYSLOG.
								<li>
								The ACE reactors have been changed to reference count the Event Handlers. This
								mechanism is particularly needed for multi-threaded applications that can have
								multiple threads executing upcalls on a handler that needs to be shutdown in a
								safe manner.
								<li>
								fixed bug 1237 - Race condition while handling location forwards
								<li>
								fixed bug 1572 - Deadlock in AMH calls if no response is sent
								<li>
								The IFR_Service's multicast discovery has been changed to default to off. The
								option -m enables multicast and -l (lowercase L) enables locking.
								<li>
								The Portable Interceptors have been changed to not try to marshal parameters
								during location forwards.
								<li>
								The transport has been changed to close a connection when it receives a partial
								GIOP header.
								<li>
									The file <code>TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/md5c.c</code> has been renamed to <code>TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/md5c.cpp</code>
								This was done because 64-bit compilers have trouble with the syntax as plain C.
								<li>
									<b>NOTE</b>: To build the <b>TAO_AV</b> library, <b>DELETE</b> the <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/md5c.c</code>
								file.
								<li>
								There are warnings when building some of the ORB services on Macintosh and
								VxWorks operating systems. These are a result of unusual linking methods of
								templates on these systems.
								<li>
									Added new option, <code>-ORBVerboseLogging</code>, to turn on the <code>VERBOSE</code>
									or <code>VERBOSE_LITE</code> flag in <code>ACE_Log_Msg</code>. Range of values
									are <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, or <b>2</b> for <em>no verbose</em> (the default), <code>VERBOSE_LITE</code>,
									and <code>VERBOSE</code>, respectively. The <code>VERBOSE</code> option
									prefixes all ORB debug messages with a time/date stamp, while <code>VERBOSE_LITE</code>
									adds even more information, e.g., the host on which the message originated.
								</li>

						<!--------------------------- PATCH 1 -------------------------->
						<li>
							<h3>Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a_p1</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								The examples from the TAO Developer's Guide have been added to the distribution
								and are built and run on the supported platforms.
								<li>
								There have been extensive improvements made to the Make Project Creator and its
								use in ACE/TAO. It is now the default build mechanism. All parts of ACE/TAO
								have been converted to use MPC.
								<li>
								The support for wide character sets has been enhanced.
								<li>
									The multithreaded part of the Naming Service Test
									($TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/) fails intermittently on several
									platforms. This failure is in the test client and does not appear to be a
									problem with the Naming Service itself. The problem appears to be with the
									default transport multiplexing strategy used by the ORB. The default strategy
									is to multiplex the use of the connection (<code>-ORBTransportMuxStrategy muxed</code>)
									and the problem only occurs when the connections are very heavily used. The
									problem does not occur if an exclusive strategy (<code>-ORBTransportMuxStrategy
										exclusive</code>) is used. It is unknown, but suspected that this problem
								may be related to Bug 1020 mentioned above.
								<li>
									The ImR is at least partially functional in 1.3a. Some known problems are:
									<ul>
										<li>
										Activator has no way to shutdown cleanly, and hence doesn't unregister from the
										locator.
										<li>
										Locator also has no way to shutdown cleanly.
										<li>
										Persistence does not appear to work, but that could just be a problem with the
										test.
										<li>
										Performance is poor.
										<li>
										The activator needs to notice when a server is down, and automatically remove
										it from the locator.
										<li>
										Servers should self-register without requiring "tao_imr add".
										<li>
											Activator does not shutdown its servers when closing.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p></p>
								<li>
									Support for the Green Hills Integrity OS (ACE/TAO) and the Green Hills tool kit
									(ACE only) has been added.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
						<li>
							<h3>Pending bugs/fixes in TAO 1.3a</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								There is a bug in CDR operator generation for octet sequences. While this bug
								does not cause incorrect behavior it greatly affects the performance of octet
								sequences.
								<li>
								There is a pending change to the IDL compiler to fix a problem where the
								compiler gets confused due to multiple slashes in paths.
								<li>
									The various tutorials in the <code>ACE_wrappers/TAO/docs/tutorials/</code> directory
									have not been tested and may not run correctly out-of-the-box.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
						<li>
							<h3>Features added to TAO 1.3a since TAO 1.3.1</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								MakeProjectCreator (MPC) -- MPC can be used to generate build tool specific
								project files (which is just a collection of source files that make up a single
								build target) from a generic mpc file. MPC takes platform specific input along
								with the build tool generic files and generates build tool specific files.
								Currently supported tools include GNU Make, NMake, Visual C++ 6, Visual C++ 7.0
								and others.
								<li>
								Redundant Naming Service -- A new option for the Naming Service has been added
								to allow the Naming Service to use a shared flat file on two or more separate
								computers. Full capabilities are available only on Tru64 clusters, but limited
								capabilities are available on any platform that the flat-file persistent Naming
								Service will run.
								<li>
								Shared source on Windows -- It has been possible for users on UNIX and
								UNIX-like platforms to use create_ace_build to build on multiple platforms from
								the same source. The capability has been added to do this on the Windows
								platforms also.
								<li>
								Input stream processing -- Input stream processing has been overhauled to
								eliminate the so-called "parse_magic_bytes" bug. The particular problem was
								very difficult to cause, and symptoms could vary from occasional unexpected
								connection closure to full core dump. This change had negligible impact on
								performance.
								<li>
									MAC OS X -- TAO support for the Macintosh OS X operating system has been added
									to the existing ACE support in TAO 1.3.1.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
						<li>
							<h3>Features added since TAO 1.2a as part of TAO 1.3.1</h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Persistent State Service (PSS) describes a way of making a service persistent.
								The fact that PSS is being used by a service is known only to the service
								(server) and not to the client which makes use of the service. PSS presents
								persistent information as storage objects stored in storage homes, to quote the
								specification. The storage homes are the datastores where the persistent data
								is saved.
								<li>
								SSLIOP pluggable protocol ships with 1.3a. This allow users to use an SSL
								implementation (not shipped with ACE/TAO) as a communication conduit.
								<li>
								There is a new Load Balancing Service that implements the current joint load
								balancing submission revision of the OMG.
								<li>
								There is a new Logging Service, aka Telecom Log Service. It is a composite of
								four separate services, Basic_Logging Service (similar to the previous logging
								service), Event_Logging Service, Notify_Logging Service, and RTEvent_Logging
								Service.
								<li>
								The final MIOP specification has recently been adopted by the OMG. TAO's MIOP
								support (located in $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup) enables servants
								to receive requests sent to multicast addresses. This is performed by creating
								a GroupId that identifies the multicast group and associating it with one or
								more servants. Additionally, the Unreliable IP Multicast (UIPMC) pluggable
								protocol is used to send and receive multicast requests. Multicast endpoints
								can be created dynamically at runtime.
								<li>
								There is a new XML Parser for the Service Configurator. The current syntax is
								still the default in version 1.3a with the new syntax available as an option.
								The next version will change the default, but still keep the old syntax
								available.
								<li>
								Many additional regression tests have been added.
								<li>
								ACE ported to Windows CE 3 with Pocket PC 2002 SDK, and Windows CE .NET with
								Standard SDK complete.
								<li>
								AIX and HP-UX can now use g++ 3.2 (previous versions of g++ were not reliable
								on these platforms).
								<li>
								The conversion of ACE/TAO documentation to Doxygen has been completed.
								<li>
									Support for the Itanium platform with Windows XP, HP-UX, and RedHat 2.1as has
									been added.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
						<li>
							<h3>Important bug fixes since TAO 1.2a</h3>
							<ul>
								<p>
									Many bugs have been fixed or work-arounds provided since TAO 1.2a. Here we
									highlight a few of the more important bug fixes since TAO 1.2a, focusing

								* Bug 1020 (<a href="http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1020"> http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1020</a>)
								deserves special explanation. The problem, as described in the bug report,
								could cause a multithreaded client with a connection to a server to crash if
								the server died. A client thread, trying to send a request to the server, may
								attempt to close the connection. Meanwhile, another thread might awaken in the
								reactor and also attempt to close the connection, resulting in a segmentation
								violation and crash. The partial solution, designed and implemented by <a href="mailto:bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu">
									Balachandran Natarajan</a>, is similar in spirit to how the TCP state machine
								models connection teardown. Connection closure in the ORB is now modeled as an
								event that is handled through the ORB's leader-followers mechanism. In
								addition, event handling along the invocation path and along the connection
								handling path were separated for better separation of concerns. A regression
								test, <code>$TAO_ROOT/tests/Bug_1020_Regression</code>, was also added.

							<strong>Compile Notes</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
								There are some warnings when compiling using Visual C++ 7.1
								<li>
									If using MPC to generate build files, then by default qos and ssl, and any
									projects that depend on these libraries will not be generated. To enable these
									features, simply create a text file called <tt>ACE_wrappers\bin\MakeProjectCreator\config\default.features</tt>
									with the following contents.
									<pre>
ssl = 1
qos = 1
</pre>
								<li>
								When building static libraries you may have to build twice. The first time will
								generate the IDL, and compile everything that didn't rely on idl-generated
								files that don't exist. The second time will finish building files now that the
								idl-generated files exist.
								<li>
									To use Visual C++ 7.1, you must use MakeProjectCreator (MPC) to generate the
									project files. Assuming <tt>ACE_wrappers\bin</tt> is in your path, you can
									simply run the following command from the <tt>ACE_wrappers</tt> directory.
									<pre>
mwc.pl -type vc71 -recurse
</pre>
									This will generate all Solutions and Project files. (Some tests and examples
									are not finished yet, but will likely be included in a subsequent patch
									release.) You can generate project files for Visual C++ 6 and other platforms
									in exactly the same way except with a different -type.
								</li>
							</ul>
						<p>
							<hr>
							<strong>Execution Notes</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The Itanium release build may not run on some older platforms. The build was
									done with the Feburary 2003 SDK and it appears to be incompatible with our
									earlier versions of the DLLs delivered with Itanium Windows 2002. The Itanium
									debug build runs on the same platform.
								</li>
							</ul>
						<p>
							</hr>
							<hr>
							<strong>create_ace_build.pl</strong>
						<p>
							You can now use this perl script to set up a build for ACE/TAO, so that
							multiple builds can share a single code base (this is a new feature with 1.3a).
							You must run this command from within the <tt>ACE_wrappers</tt> directory, and <tt>
								ACE_wrappers\bin</tt> should be in your path. Example:
							<pre>
create_ace_build.pl vc71
</pre>
							Running this command will create a directory called <tt>ACE_wrappers\builds\vc71</tt>.
							Most of the directory structure under ACE_wrappers will be duplicated under
							this directory, and hard links will be created back to the files under
							ACE_wrappers. For example, if you modify <tt>ACE_wrappers\ace\OS.h</tt>, then <tt>
								ACE_wrappers\builds\vc71\ace\OS.h</tt> will automatically be modified.
							Windows does not support symbolic links, so that if you delete a file, it will
							not automatically be deleted. If you then add a new file with the same name as
							the old one, it will <em>not</em> be linked. To refresh your links in this
							case, you can run <tt>create_ace_build.pl</tt>
						without any options, and it will update all links for every build. You can set
						up as many builds as you want by simply running the script again with a
						different argument.
						<p>
						By default, it's assumed that you will use MPC to generate any project files
						for the new build, so no project files or Makefiles are linked from
						ACE_wrappers.
						<p>
							</hr>
							<hr>
							<strong>Tests</strong>
						<p>
						A scattering of ACE and TAO tests fail, but no test/feature fails across
						platforms. In addition, the notify service will not load when building release
						mode Borland 5.5. (This will likely be fixed in a subsequent patch release.)

									and built. Or a pre-built version may be loaded with fink (<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">http://fink.sourceforge.net/</a>).
									If the fink version is used, you will need to add:
									<pre>
      #define ACE_NEEDS_DL_UNDERSCORE
</pre>
								to your config.h file.
								<li>
									Certain parts of the TAO will not build with the version of gmake in the
									versions of Mac OS X 10.2 available as of this writing. You will need to
									download <tt>gmake</tt> version 3.80 (or better) <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/">
										http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/</a>.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<hr>
							<b>Notes</b>
						<p>
						The major problem with getting TAO to run on Mac OS X was lack of full
						initialization of static objects. About half of the tests were failing. Apple
						is aware of the problem, but a fix does not appear to be imminent. Seems to be
						somewhat difficult problem with some legacy implications. Thus, for ACE/TAO the
						Mac will not be supportable for any earlier versions than 1.3a of ACE/TAO and
						10.2.x of Mac OS X.
						<p>
						There are three or four environment variables that are required to be defined
						in the user's environment.
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<tt>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> which operates as <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>
								on most other UNIX like systems.
								<li>
									<tt>DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH=1</tt>
								is required to make the dlcompat package work. This package is used to
								implement the dynamic loading used by the Service Configurator. When this is
								set, the dynamic linker binds all undefined symbols the program needs at launch
								time. This includes function symbols that can are normally lazily bound at the
								time of their first call. When Apple gets around to providing this capability
								natively, we may be able to eliminate this variable; that would be good since
								it adversely affects performance.
								<li>
									<tt>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="10.2"</tt> is requires to get rid of a lot of
									annoying warning. It might also fix a couple of things that we have worked
									around.
									<p>
									And, if you are building ACE/TAO and wish to run the tests,
									<p></p>
								<li>
									<tt>ACE_RUNTEST_DELAY</tt> provides a multiplier to the times specified in a
									test. <tt>ACE_RUNTEST_DELAY=2</tt> is needed to make more than 20 tests run in
									that the <tt>DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH=1</tt> slows process startup beyond the 5
									seconds allowed for startup.</li>
							</ul>
						<p>
							</hr>
							<hr>
							<strong>Tests</strong>
						<p>
							2 ACE tests fail
							<ul>
								<li>
								The Process_Mutex is broken on Mac OS X and has been reported to Apple. It is
								needed in TAO for AV and some other places. The implementation uses a POSIX
								named semaphore, as the OS does not implement either system level mutex or SYSV
								style semaphores that are used in other implementations. Apple is looking at
								this problem.
								<li>
									The MEM_Stream_Test fails since it uses a Process_Mutex.
								</li>
							</ul>
							Several TAO tests fail.
							<ul>
								<li>
								The exception part of the two Param_Tests fails. The problem here is that the
								compiler interprets the exception spec literally. The test tries to trick the
								compiler into throwing an exception that is not defined. What happens is the
								unexpected exception is actually caught and, since it is not handled, the
								process aborts.
								<li>
								10 orbsvcs tests fail in debug build but not in optimize build. This is likely
								a timing issue, but will need further work.
								<li>
								4 AV tests fail and the tests that use SHMIIOP, probably because they require a
								Process_Mutex, which is known to be broken.
								<li>
									Several RTCORBA tests fail due to the lack of get_prio.
								</li>
							</ul>
						Conclusion: ACE/TAO and Mac OS X both need a bit more work, but 1.3a should be
						usable for most CORBA applications with the restrictions noted in the test
						section above.

						uses in its own builds. For UNIX and UNIX-like platforms that use GNU Make, use
						platform_macros.GNU. For Windows/Visual C++ builds, use config.h. If an option
						is not listed below, let it default.
