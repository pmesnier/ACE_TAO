Q: Why do I experience a run-time link error, even though my
   path and environment variables are set correctly and I have a fresh
   build tree?

A: You may have an older version of one of the ACE, TAO, or CIAO
   libraries somewhere in your library search path (e.g.,
   <code>PATH</code> on Windows, <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> on
   Linux) that you don't know about, even though you have only one
   build tree of ACE+TAO+CIAO.  For example, the CoSMIC tool chain
   installer ships with the ACE libraries and installs them on your
   system.  The same is true of OCI's TAO distribution CDs.

<p>
   If you do have an out-dated version of one of the ACE, TAO, or CIAO
   libraries (e.g., <code>ACE.dll</code>), and  its path appears in
   the library search path before <code>$ACE_ROOT/lib</code> from your
   build tree, you will have run-time link errors.  The run-time
   linker tries to link your program against the first occurrence of
   the library that it finds in the library search path.
</p>

<p>
   You can confirm that this is the problem you are having by moving
   the problematic library in your build tree to a backup file and
   re-running your application.  If you still experience the run-time
   link error, then you probably have another (stale) version of the
   problematic library on your system.  (The <code>ldd</code> command
   on Linux and Unix can be very helpful in tracking down where the
   out-dated library is located.)  To correct the problem, ensure that
   <code>$ACE_ROOT/lib</code> comes first in the library search path.
   On Windows, you will need to restart your terminal windows and
   development environment.
