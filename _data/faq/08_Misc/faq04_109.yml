Q: What are these CORBA::Environment parameters?  Why do I get errors about pure virtual functions?

A: >
 The <code>CORBA::Environment</code> parameters are part of
 the alternate exception mapping defined by the OMG's IDL to
 C++ language mapping specification.  Normally, CORBA
 exceptions are mapped to C++ exceptions.  The mapping also
 allows CORBA to be used when C++ exceptions are unavailable or
 undesirable by passing exception information via an extra
 parameter of type <code>CORBA::Environment</code>.  TAO
 versions up to 1.5.1 support both mappings and you can build
 ACE/TAO to support either mapping by passing
 <code>exceptions=0</code> or <code>exceptions=1</code> to GNU
 make or by defining the macro <code>ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS</code>.
 
 <p>
 If you build TAO to use native C++ exceptions, the IDL
 compiler, by default, does not include the
 <code>CORBA::Environment</code> parameters.  If you build with
 the alternate mapping, the IDL compiler includes the
 <code>CORBA::Environment</code> parameter by default.  You can
 explicitly tell the IDL compiler what to do with the
 <code>-Ge</code> option (<code>-Ge 1</code> includes the extra
 parameter, <code>-Ge 0</code> omits it).  You need to generate
 the skeleton classes in a manner that is compatible with your
 servant classes or you will receive compiler errors about
 abstract classes or pure virtual functions.
