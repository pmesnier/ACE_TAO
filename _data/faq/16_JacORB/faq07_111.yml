Q: JacORB is using the wrong Ethernet adapter address.  What should I do?

A: >
 You can inform JacORB which Ethernet adapter to use by specifing it in the 
 jacorb.properties file (it could also be passed in on the command line).  
 Just set the OAIAddr property to the IP address that you want JacORB to use.  
 For example, on my Windows98 machine which has a DSL modem, JacORB was using 
 the adapter Ethernet address 5.0.0.4 instead of the true public IP address.  
 I modified OAIAddr property and everything worked fine.  BTW you can see what 
 address JacORB is attempting to connect to by setting jacorb.verbosity to 2.<br>
 For example:
 <pre>  java -Djacorb.verbosity=2 -DOAIAddr=12.345.67.89 Client<br></pre>
 <br>
