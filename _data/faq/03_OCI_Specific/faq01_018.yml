Q: What's the advantage to buying OCI's Distribution of TAO?

A: Depending
upon your circumstances, there may be several advantages to buying OCI's
Distribtution of TAO rather than closely tracking the beta source code kits: 
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Stability</b>: OCI's Distribution of TAO is based on a stable, tested, and
supported release of TAO.  If you need a solid, consistent version of
TAO on which to base your product or project, this is the one for you.
If you need to stay abreast of new research directions or want to try
out the latest features, you can still obtain TAO beta kits in source
code form by visiting <a href="http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/">http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/</a>.<br>
<li> <b>Time Savings</b>: Buying and installing a prebuilt binary distribution of TAO, rather
than downloading source code and building it yourself, can save you
hours of work.  In addition, you can be sure that it has been built
correctly and tested across several platforms, operating systems, and
compilers, and in several different configurations.<br>
<li> <b>Installation Support</b>: OCI provides 90 days of installation support for registered purchasers
of prebuilt binary distributions of TAO.  We want to make sure
you are up and running with TAO as quickly as possible.<br>
<li> <b>Documentation</b>: Using OCI's Distribution of TAO is easy with OCI's <em>TAO Developer's Guide</em> (available for purchase at
<a href="http://www.theaceorb.com/purchase/index.html">http://www.theaceorb.com/purchase/index.html</a>).
In addition to the documentation set, you can view the latest TAO 
release notes at <a href="http://www.theaceorb.com/releasenotes/index.html">http://www.theaceorb.com/releasenotes/index.html</a>.<br>
<li> <b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>: OCI maintains a list of frequently asked questions about TAO.  This
list is updated regularly by our staff of distributed object computing
technology engineers to provide answers to common questions about
using TAO.  Anyone in the TAO user community can contribute questions
(and answers) to the FAQ.  Check it first to see if your question has
been asked before.  The FAQ is located at <a href="http://www.theaceorb.com/faq/">http://www.theaceorb.com/faq/</a><br>

asked questions, such as object technology training, consulting,
