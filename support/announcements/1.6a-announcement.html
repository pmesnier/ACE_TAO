	<p>OCI's TAO 1.6a release is based on the DOC (see<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/doc-group.html"><font color="#660000">
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-group.html</font></a>) group's TAO&nbsp;1.6.7

customers.<br /><br />TAO 1.6a includes many new features and improvements over the
previous commercially supported (TAO 1.5a) release and has been extensively
tested across a wide variety of platforms (over 14,000 tests run on over 30
