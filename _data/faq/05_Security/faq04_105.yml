Q: Is it legal for me to have this?  What sort of legalities are there in using this?

A: >
 First,
 we're software developers and not lawyers.  We might be able to write good
 software, but it takes a mind far more twisted than ours to understand US
 Export regulations, especially on cryptography and security issues.  Therefore,
 if you have concerns, you should consult <em>your</em> lawyer. <p>
 That said, you might look at <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/Encryption/">http://www.bis.doc.gov/Encryption/</a> for current information from the U.S. Government if you're under its jurisdiction.
