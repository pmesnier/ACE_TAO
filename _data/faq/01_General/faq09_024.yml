Q: Why doesn't TAO support the BOA?

A: >
 The short answer is that the BOA (Basic Object Adapter) is no longer part of the CORBA specification.<br>
  The BOA was removed because of its lack of portability and underspecification
 among various other shortcomings.  The main argument for adding BOA support
 to TAO is migration of existing CORBA applications.  Because the BOA is implemented
 differently by each vendor, porting to a TAO BOA would probably be the same
 amount of work as porting to the POA (which provides true cross-vendor  portability).
  All in all, applications are probably better off making the transition to
 the POA.<br>
