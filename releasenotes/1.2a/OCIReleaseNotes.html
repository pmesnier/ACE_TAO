	    <p>
	      TAO 1.2a derives from the DOC TAO 1.2.1 beta kit with bugfix-related patches
	      selectively applied to enhance stability.  A record of applied patches can
	      be found in <strong>OCIChangeLog</strong> files
	      installed with the distribution.  At the time of this release, the current
	      DOC beta kit was TAO 1.2.2.

	    <p>
	      This CD's format is ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge and Joliet extensions.  Thus, it
	      should be readable on nearly every Unix platform (Rock Ridge extensions) as
	      well as Windows (Joliet extensions).  We mastered it using the freely-available <a
	      href="http://www.ps.ucl.ac.uk/~jcpearso/mkhybrid.html">mkhybrid</a> tool, and
	      recorded it using the freely-available <a

	  <li class="l2"><a name="gnumake"></a><span class="l2">GNU Make Required on Unix</span>
	    <p>
	      With the exception of Windows operating systems,
	      building ACE and TAO from source code requires GNU Make.  While you can use
	      other tools to build applications using ACE &amp; TAO, using GNU Make lets
	      you leverage the existing build system distributed with ACE &amp; TAO.  If
	      you need GNU Make, you can get a source distribution through <a
	      href="{{site.baseurl}}/gnumake">{{site.baseurl}}/gnumake</a>
	      as well as other places.

	    <p>
              To install a Windows build of TAO 1.2a from CD, run
              setup on a Windows platform.  Likewise, to install for
              a UNIX or UNIX-like platform, run setup on a UNIX or
              UNIX-like platform.

            <p>
              During installation, a dialog will ask you to select the
              service executables you wish to install.  The dialog
              lists two event service executables, and does not
              provide much help in discerning the difference.
            <p>
              Select <b>CosEvent</b> to install the service executable
              for the OMG's CosEvent service; select <b>Event</b> to
              install the service executable for TAO's Real-Time Event
              service (RTEC).

      <li class="l1"><a name="updates"></a><span class="l1">New Features Since TAO 1.1a</span>
        <p>
	<ol type="a">

	  <li class="l2"><a name="corba25"></a><span class="l2">Major
          feature-compliance with OMG's CORBA 2.5 specification</span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a complies with most features of the CORBA 2.5
            specification, including the following specific features:<p>
            <ul>
              <li class="l2"><span class="l2">OMG Real-time (RT) CORBA
              specification</span>
              <p>TAO 1.2a includes support for the OMG RT CORBA
              specification.  RT CORBA, an optional part of the CORBA
              2.5 specification, is designed to give developers a high
              degree of control over the allocation and management of
              run-time resources to improve quality of service (QoS) and
              end-to-end predictability in time-critical applications.</p>
              <li class="l2"><span class="l2">Portable
              Interceptors</span>
              <p>TAO 1.2a adds complete support for CORBA-compliant
              Portable Interceptors. Portable Interceptors in CORBA are
              objects that the ORB invokes at predefined points in the
              request and reply paths of an operation invocation or
              during the generation of an interoperable object reference
              (IOR). Developers can define their own code to be executed
              at each interception point to perform application-specific
              tasks such as logging, debugging, or security and
              authentication.</p>
              <li class="l2"><span class="l2">Bi-directional
              GIOP/IIOP</span>
              <p>TAO 1.2a includes full support for bi-directional
              GIOP/IIOP. Bi-directional GIOP provides a solution to the
              problem of invoking methods on clients behind a firewall.</p>
              <li class="l2"><span class="l2">Dynamic Anys</span>
              <p>TAO 1.2a includes full support for CORBA-compliant
              Dynamic Anys. Previously (in TAO 1.1a), Dynamic Anys were
              based on the earlier CORBA 2.2 specification.</p>
              <li class="l2"><span class="l2">Locality-constrained
              interfaces ("local")</span>
              <p>TAO 1.2a adds support for <em>local</em> interfaces
              from CORBA 3 and includes local implementations of several
              standard interfaces, such as the Portable Object Adapter
              (POA) and servant managers. Local interfaces obviate the
              need to define special pseudo-objects and pseudo IDL
              (PIDL) for objects that are never called remotely, such as
              the POA and ORB interfaces.</p>
            </ul>
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="security1"></a><span class="l2">Support for OMG CORBA Security Level 1 specification</span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a adds support for the OMG CORBA Security Level 1
            specification. OMG's Security Service specification is a
            comprehensive treatment of security as it relates to
            distributed object systems and applications.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="improved_idl"></a><span class="l2">Improved
          IDL compiler</span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a introduces many IDL compiler enhancements and bug
            fixes, including support for re-opened modules and forward
            declaration of an interface that is defined in a separate
            IDL file.
	    <p>

          <li class="l2"><a name="realtime_emulation"></a><span class="l2">
          Availability of Real-time Emulation</span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a adds a <em>virtual real-time emulator</em> to
            enable real-time performance analysis on non-real-time
            platforms.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="additional_platforms"></a><span class="l2">
          Additional configuration options and support for additional
          platforms</span>
	    <p>
            In TAO 1.2a, support has been extended to new platforms,
            operating systems, and C++ compilers, including several
            64-bit and real-time operating systems. Supported operating
            systems include Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Tru64,
            IRIX, VxWorks, LynxOS, ChorusOS, ReliantUNIX, UnixWare, and
            OS/9.  TAO 1.2a also introduces changes to configuration
            options to allow developers and administrators complete
            control over their application's run-time environment.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="footprint_reduction"></a><span class="l2">
          Options for Footprint Reduction and improved modularization</span>
	    <p>
            In TAO 1.2a, the core TAO library has been divided into many
            smaller libraries so applications only need to link in the
            features they need.  In addition, TAO 1.2a includes an
            application development tool that you can use to build
            minimal libraries containing only those features that your
            application actually uses.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="improved_pp"></a><span class="l2">
          Improved Pluggable Protocol framework with additional
          pluggable protocols
          </span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a comes with an improved open pluggable protocols
            framework so developers can create their own transports that
            seamlessly integrate with the rest of the TAO ORB. Custom
            protocols can be developed to improve performance, reduce
            bandwidth consumption, enforce security, or allow the ORB to
            operate over proprietary transport protocols. Applications
            need not be aware of the existence of these custom
            protocols.
	    <p>
            In addition to OMG-standard IIOP, TAO 1.2a includes
            implementations of the following pluggable protocols: UIOP
            (uses UNIX-domain sockets), SHMIOP (shared memory
            transport), DIOP (UDP-based transport), and SSLIOP (uses the
            OpenSSL implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer).
            <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="interoperable_naming"></a><span class="l2">
          Complete support for Interoperable Naming Service
          </span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a provides complete support for the OMG Interoperable
            Naming Service specification, including
            <code>corbaloc</code> and <code>corbaname</code> object URLs
            and support for the <code>CosNaming::NamingContextExt</code>
            interface.
            <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="improved_notification"></a><span class="l2">
          Improvements in the Notification Service
          </span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a includes many enhancements to TAO's implementation
            of the OMG Notification Service, including multithreaded
            event dispatching and filter evaluation, full ETCL filtering
            constraint grammar, support for the
            <code>SequencePushConsumer</code> interface, and support for
            most of the standard quality of service (QoS) properties.
            <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="improved_mcast"></a><span class="l2">
          Improved Multicast Service Discovery
          </span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a provides developers and administrators with better
            control over multicast discovery of TAO's CORBA services
            (such as the Naming and Object Trader services) and the
            addition of a new <code>mcast:</code> object URL scheme.
            <p>

          Implementation of OMG Interface Repository
          </span>
	    <p>
            TAO 1.2a adds an implementation of the OMG Interface
            Repository specification for dynamic discovery of IDL types
            and interfaces.

      <li class="l1"><a name="building_apps"></a><span class="l1">Quickstart for Building with TAO</span>

	<p>
	  This section contains a few things you will need to know to build applications
	  which use the TAO and ACE libraries distributed on this CD.  You can find more
	  detailed information in <a href="bldgapps.html">bldgapps.html</a>, adapted
          from the <a
	  href="http://theaceorb.com/TAO/About/product_descriptions.html"><em>TAO
	  Developer's Guide</em> (OCI part number tbd)</a>, <a
	  href="http://theaceorb.com/TAO/Purchase_TAO/purchase_tao.html">available
	  for purchase online</a>.
	<p>

        <ol type="a">
	  <li class="l2"><a name="building_unix"></a><span class="l2">TAO on UNIX</span>

	    <p>
              On UNIX and UNIX-like systems, you should use GNU Make to build applications
              with TAO.  The document <a
              href="bldgapps.html#UNIX_Section">bldgapps.html</a> shows
              an <a href="bldgapps.html#makefileexample">example Makefile</a>.
            <p>
              Briefly, you will need to set the following environment variables:
            <p>

            <dl>
              <dt><code>ACE_ROOT</code></dt>
              <dd>The base of your ACE and TAO installation</dd>

              <dt><code>TAO_ROOT</code></dt>
              <dd><code>$ACE_ROOT/TAO</code></dd>

              <dt><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH (SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX)</code></dt>
              <dd>Must include <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
              These can all be set by "sourcing" the environment script located
              in your ACE_wrappers directory.
              For example, assuming the base of your installation of TAO is in
              <code>/usr/local/ACE_wrappers</code>, and assuming you are using the
              C-shell (csh):
            <p>
	      <div class="out">
source /usr/local/ACE_wrappers/ace_env.csh<br>
              </div>
              <em>Note: <code>ace_env.sh</code> is also supplied for Bourne-like Shell users</em>
            <p>

            <p>
              To build applications with ACE/TAO the following environment variables need to be set:
            <p>

            <dl>
              <dt><code>ACE_ROOT</code></dt>
              <dd>The base of your ACE and TAO installation</dd>

              <dt><code>TAO_ROOT</code></dt>
              <dd><code>%ACE_ROOT%\TAO</code></dd>

              <dt><code>PATH</code></dt>
              <dd>Must include <code>%ACE_ROOT%\bin</code></dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              See <a href="bldgapps.html#Setting_UNIX_Env_Vars">bldgapps.html</a> for detailed instructions on setting the environment variables for the various Unix OSs.  On Windows NT, 2000 and XP, the installer script sets the ACE_ROOT and TAO_ROOT environment variables, but you need to explicitly add the specified directory to the PATH variable.    You may need to log out and back in to actually see these variables propagated to all running processes.  On Windows 98, you need to explictly set all the variables listed above.
            <p>
              You also need to add various directories to the global Visual C++ settings so that VC++ can properly locate the ACE/TAO header files and libraries.  This is described in <a href="bldgapps.html#Setting_Visual_CPP_Options">bldgapps.html</a>.
            <p>
              Any existing Visual C++ projects that need to use TAO should be modified as described in <a href="bldgapps.html#createproject">bldgapps.html</a>.  Briefly, you need to:
            <ul>
              <li> Modify the default compiler settings to use
                   multi-threaded DLLs;
              <li> Modify the Input Object/Library modules to use the
                   debug or release versions of the ACE, TAO, and
                   orbsvcs libraries, as appropriate for your
                   development environment;
              <li> Set up a custom build configuration to invoke the TAO
                   IDL compiler to generate C++ header and source files
                   from OMG IDL files.
              </ul>

        </ol>
	<p>

      <li class="l1"><a name="sample_app"></a><span class="l1">Sample Application</span>
            <p>
              The CD includes a sample application which you can build and run to verify
              that your installation of TAO was successful.  The application consists of a
              simple message server and client.  The client sends a message to the
              server by invoking an operation on a Messenger object.
            <p>
              Source code for this application is found on the CD in the file
              <code>example.tgz</code>.  We have also included a Makefile for building the
              application on UNIX and UNIX-like systems, and a Visual C++ project file
              for building it on Windows.
            <p>
              On UNIX and UNIX-like platforms, use <code>gunzip</code> and
              <code>tar</code> to uncompress and unpack this file.  Then, run GNU Make in the
              example directory to build the MessengerServer and MessengerClient.  You can
              then run them after they are successfully built.
            <p>
              On Windows, use <code>WinZip</code> or another zip utility to unpack the file.  You will find a
              Visual C++ workspace called <code>GettingStartedVC</code> in the
              <code>example\GettingStartedVC</code> subdirectory which you can use to compile the
              interfaces and build the MessengerServer and MessengerClient programs.
            <p>
              The server creates a Messenger object and prints its IOR as a string to a file,
              then waits for client requests.  The client reads the IOR string from
              the file and sends a message using the Messenger object.  The server then prints
              the contents of the message to stdout.
            <p>
              Here is sample output from running the server and client on Linux:
            <p>

            <div class="out">
$ MessengerServer &<br>
[1] 25291<br>
IOR written to file Messenger.ior<br>
<br>
$ MessengerClient<br>
