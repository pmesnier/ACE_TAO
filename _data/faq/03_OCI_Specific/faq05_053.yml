Q: Is it possible to install debug and release versions of TAO on the same Windows machine?

A: >
 It is
 possible to install both debug and release versions of TAO on one Windows machine
 by selecting a different installation directory for each installation and
 setting $ACE_ROOT and $TAO_ROOT appropriately. More efficienty, the debug
 and release versions of TAO can be installed in the same directory since
 the different versions of the libraries have slightly different names. <br>
