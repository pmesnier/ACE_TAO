Q: What is TransportCurrent library used for ?

A: >
 It provides an implementation of an interface(Transport::Current) for obtaining common transport
 information and an implementation of IIOP specific interface (Transport::IIOP::Current) for obtaining
 IIOP specific transport information. On the other hand it also is a framework for implementing
 transport-specific plug-ins (for querying specific transport, other than IIOP).

 Please see $TAO_ROOT/docs/transport_current/index.html for description of the Transport Current feature.
