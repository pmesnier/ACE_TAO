Q: Why do I get this: ACE_DLL::open failed for TAO_Codeset?

A: Codeset negotiation is an optional feature for TAO. It is implemented in a
separate shared library, libTAO_Codeset.so, or TAO_Codeset.dll on Windows.
Typically, TAO is not explicitly linked to the codeset library, rather it
relies on the ACE Service Configuration framework to load the library for it.
<p>
The error in question is reported when ACE cannot find the Codeset library in
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or the runtime PATH on Windows. While most error or
warning reports such as the one in question are guarded by a log-level test,
this one is not, because the code in question is often used in static
initializers, which are called before a log-level determination can be made.
