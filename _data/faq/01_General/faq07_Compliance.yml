Q: With which OMG CORBA specifications is TAO compliant?

A: Compliance, just like source code and the specifications
themselves, is a moving target.  Each version of TAO is
compliant with various OMG CORBA specifications.

<p>
Each version of the <a
href="http://www.theaceorb.com/purchase/index.html"><em>TAO Developer's Guide</em></a>
includes an appendix that discusses compliance of that version
of TAO in detail.  These appendices are available via <a
