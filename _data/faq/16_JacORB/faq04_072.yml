Q: Does JacORB support the &quot;iioploc&quot; object reference format?

A: >
 No, JacORB (as well as versions of TAO 1.1.10 and later) uses the "corbaloc" object reference format. See LINK:073: for more information about using "corbaloc" object references between JacORB (or any client) and TAO servers.
