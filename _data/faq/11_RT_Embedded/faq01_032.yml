Q: Where can I see performance comparisons between TAO and &lt;some other ORB&gt;?

A: It's not
as easy to compare the performance of ORBs as generically as one might compare,
e.g., the performance of microprocessors.  There are no standard benchmarks
available at the present.  Thus, any evaluation of performance of an ORB
is largely dependent on the application and its characteristics as well as
the environment in which it's running (such as over an ATM network vs. ethernet
vs. wireless, etc.). <p> That said, you might be able to get a better
feeling of the situations in which various ORBs "shine" (performance-wise)
by looking at some of the benchmarks available through the following links: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz/projects.phtml?p=mbench&q=3">Distributed Systems Research Group, Charles University, Prague</a></li>

<li> <a href="http://www.atl.external.lmco.com/projects/QoS/compare/dist_oo_compare_ipc.html">LMCO Advanced Technology Labs' Middleware Comparator</a></li>
</ul>
<p> Finally, don't forget that nothing comes without a cost, so carefully
evaluate the entire ORB <em>package</em>, not just the performance. <br>
