Q: What's the minimum set of directories I need to build to be able to develop applications with ACE and TAO?

A: >
 One common
 way to build ACE and TAO (once you have your configuration set up) is to
 simply run "make" in the $ACE_ROOT directory, then run "make" again in the
 $TAO_ROOT directory.  However, running "make" from $ACE_ROOT not only builds
 the ACE library, it also builds all of the examples, tests, and other things
 you may not need.  Likewise, running "make" from $TAO_ROOT builds not only
 the TAO and orbsvcs libraries, it also builds all the TAO and orbsvcs tests
 and examples. <p> To build only what you need to develop applications with ACE and TAO
 (and to save LOTS of disk space while building) you can run make in only
 the following directories:<br>
 </p><pre>  $ACE_ROOT/ace
   $ACE_ROOT/apps/gperf/src
   $TAO_ROOT/TAO_IDL
   $ACE_ROOT/ACEXML
   $TAO_ROOT/tao
   $ACE_ROOT/protocols
   $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs</pre>
 <p> This will build only the ACE library, gperf executable (needed by the
 IDL compiler), tao_idl executable, ACEXML library, protocol libraries (extensions
 of the ACE framework), TAO libraries, and orbsvcs libraries.
 </p><p> If you want to also build any of the orbsvcs executables (e.g.,
 $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service), add their directories to the set of directories that you build.
  For example: </p><p>
 </p><pre>
   cd $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service
   make
 </pre>
 <p> You may also find the "nslist" and "catior" utilities very useful, so
 you probably should also add these directories to the list of directories
 in which to build:<br>
 </p>
 <pre>
   $TAO_ROOT/utils/nslist
   $TAO_ROOT/utils/catior
 </pre>
 <p>
 Of course, you can always go back and build individual tests and examples if you want to.
