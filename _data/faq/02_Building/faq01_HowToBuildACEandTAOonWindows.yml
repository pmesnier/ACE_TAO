Q: How do I obtain, configure, and build ACE and TAO on Windows with Visual C++?

A: >
 This FAQ provides basic instructions for installing and
 building ACE+TAO for Windows with Visual C++.  ACE+TAO can
 also be used on other major modern operating systems, such as
 Linux, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX, and some real-time and
 embedded operating systems, such as VxWorks, LynxOS, Timesys
 Linux, and Windows CE.
 
 <pre>
 Hardware Requirements
 
   - CPU: ACE+TAO can be configured to build on a variety of 32
     and 64 bit processors (Intel, AMD)
   - Memory: 512 MB (more memory improves compile speed)
   - Hard Drive Space: 256MB swap + 500 MB up to several GB
     free (depending upon how much you build)
 
 Operating System Requirements
 
   - Windows 2000, 2003, XP, or Vista
 
 C++ Compiler Requirements
 
   - Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1, 8, or 9
 
 Other Software Requirements
 
   - OCI's Distribution of TAO version 1.6a latest patch
     release or the latest release or micro release of ACE+TAO
     (see instructions below for obtaining and installing
     ACE+TAO)
   - WinZIP or similar tool for extracting software archives
   - ActiveState Perl v5.6.1 or newer (recommended, but not required)
 
 Obtaining and Installing ACE+TAO
 
   1. Download the latest release of OCI TAO 1.6a (with latest
      patches, if available) from:
 
      <a href="http://download.ociweb.com/TAO-1.6a/">http://download.ociweb.com/TAO-1.6a/</a>
 
      or download the latest release or micro release of ACE+TAO from:
 
      <a href="http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/">http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/</a>
 
   2. Extract the archive into a path with no spaces in the path
      name (e.g., C:\ACE_wrappers).
 
   3. Set ACE_ROOT, TAO_ROOT, and PATH environment variables.
 
      For example, if ACE+TAO are installed in C:\ACE_wrappers, the
      variables will look like this:
 
      ACE_ROOT=C:\ACE_wrappers
      TAO_ROOT=%ACE_ROOT%\TAO
      The PATH variable should contain these directories: %ACE_ROOT%\bin;%ACE_ROOT%\lib
 
   4. Create a file named config.h in %ACE_ROOT%\ace with the following
      contents:
 
      #include "ace/config-win32.h"
 
   5. Build the Debug or Release configuration of ACE+TAO using
      the solution file that matches your version of Visual
      C++.  For example, in OCI TAO 1.6a you will see the
      following solution files:
 
      %TAO_ROOT%\TAO_ACE.sln      (Visual C++ 7.1)
      %TAO_ROOT%\TAO_ACE_vc8.sln  (Visual C++ 8)
      %TAO_ROOT%\TAO_ACE_vc9.sln  (Visual C++ 9)
 
      The projects in the TAO_ACE solution build the ACE and
      TAO libraries, TAO IDL compiler, gperf, ORB services
      libraries and executables, and some common utilities.
      They do not include any examples, tests, or performance
      tests.  (Separate directories and solutions exist for
      them.) Libraries will be installed in %ACE_ROOT%\lib.
      Some executables will be installed in %ACE_ROOT%\bin,
      others (the ORB services executables) will be installed
      in their source directories.
 
   6. If you don't want to build all of the libraries and
      executables from the TAO_ACE solution, we recommend just
      building the <strong>Naming_Service</strong> project.
      It, and the projects on which it depends, includes most
      of the common ACE+TAO libraries that you need for
      developing your applications.
 
   7. If the solution file you need does not exist, you will need
      to generate it using MakeProjectCreator (MPC) (requires
      Perl as listed above) with the following commands:
 
      cd %TAO_ROOT%
      %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl -type vc[version] TAO_ACE.mwc
 
      where [version] is "71", "8", or "9" for Visual C++ 7.1,
      8, or 9, respectively.
