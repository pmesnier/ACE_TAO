 <h3>Books</h3>
 <blockquote>
 
 <em>Advanced CORBA Programming with C++</em> book by Henning and Vinoski. 
 It's the equivalent of the ACE tutorial (except it's much more complete).
  This is a general C++ CORBA book and covers the standard way of doing things. 
 <p>
 The OCI <em>TAO Developer's Guide</em>, which you can purchase via
 <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/purchase/index.html">{{site.baseurl}}/purchase/index.html</a>
 .  This book picks up where the Henning and Vinoski book stops, covering
 TAO specific topics as well as CORBA standard features omitted from the Henning
 and Vinoski book. </p></blockquote>
 
 
 <h3>Online</h3>
