Q: How can I use TAO with Java's tnameserv?

A: <strong>Using tnameserv as the naming service implementation.</strong>
<p>
[From material originally posted to tao-users by Carlos O'Ryan.]<br>
 Suppose that you have a CORBA application written with TAO, and you want
to use the Java naming service implementation (<strong>tnameserv</strong>): </p><pre>
  $ tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050 &;
</pre>
<p> In order for your CORBA application to use this naming service instance,
you need to somehow get the IOR for the instance (exercise left to the reader).
 Once you get it, you can provide it to your TAO-based CORBA application
using the <strong>-ORBInitRef NameService=...</strong> command line option.  For example,
if you have the IOR as a string, you can use: </p>
<pre>
  $ app -ORBInitRef NameService=IOR:....
</pre>
Similarly, if the IOR is in a text file, you can use:
<pre>
  $ app -ORBInitRef NameService=file://path/to/file.txt
</pre>
<p> Finally, if you were so lucky for your version of <strong>tnameserv</strong> to implement
the Interoperable Naming Service specification (doubtful at the moment),
you could use: </p><pre>
  $ app -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:host:port/NameService
</pre>
In older versions of TAO (before 1.1.10) this option takes the following form:
<pre>
  $ app -ORBInitRef NameService=iioploc://host:port/NameService
</pre>
