Q: If I install TAO from the OCI CD set, do I need to build it?

A: In addition to the full source code for ACE and TAO, the OCI CD set includes
<em>pre-built</em> libraries for ACE, TAO, and TAO's CORBA
services, plus executables for TAO's IDL compiler, gperf, and servers for the
various services.
<p>
The CD set contains these pre-built components for many popular platforms,
operating systems, and C++ compilers.
</p><p>
In addition, the builds on the CD set include more than one build configuration
(i.e., debug on or off, native C++ exception support on or off).
</p><p>
Note that the CD set does <em>not</em> include pre-built binaries of the various tests,
performance tests, and examples that come with ACE and TAO, but the full source
code for them is there.
</p><p>
So, if you install TAO from the OCI CD set for one of the existing platform / 
operating system / compiler combinations, you can get started writing, building,
and running your own applications that use TAO right away.
</p><p>
Of course, since you have the full source code, you can custom build it yourself
(e.g., for a particular platform, operating system, compiler, or configuration
which is not present on the CD).
