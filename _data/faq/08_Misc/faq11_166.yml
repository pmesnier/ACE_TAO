Q: How can my TAO clients and servers communicate when the network goes
down?

A: Assuming that the clients and servers are local to one machine, it is
possible by using "localhost".  For instance, you could have a Name Service
running that is listening on the ethernet adapter and localhost:

<pre>
  Naming_Service -ORBListenEndpoints "iiop://hostname:11223;iiop://localhost:11223"
</pre>

If the network for "hostname" goes down, this Name Service could still be
accessed by a server running locally using the following:

<pre>
  server -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:hostname:11223,iiop:localhost:11223/NameService
</pre>

Regardless of the state of the network on which "hostname" is registered, the
server will be able to communicate with the Name Service due to the
localhost endpoint.
