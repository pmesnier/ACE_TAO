Q: What is the difference between TAO's Real-Time Event Service and the OMG Notification Service?

A: >
 The Notification
 Service is an implementation of the OMG's Notification Service specification,
 which originally came out of the Telecommunications working group within
 the OMG.  See <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/2000-06-20">http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/2000-06-20</a> for the specification.  The Notification Service is backwards compatible with the OMG Event Service.
 <p> The Real-Time Event Service is TAO specific.  It was developed prior
 to the adoption of the OMG Notification Service specification.  The RT Event
 Service was designed to meet the real-time and quality of service needs of
 certain sponsors of the DOC group, but has applicability in a wide variety
 of domains. </p><p> On the surface, the two services provide several similar features,
 though the specifics of their interfaces and implementations are quite different:<br>
 <ul>
 <li> similar communications model
 <li> support for structured events
 <li> filtering of events
 <li> support for subscriptions
 <li> mechanisms for specifying QoS requirements
 <li> support for delivery of sequences of events
 </ul>
 <p> In addition, the RT Event Service provides some features that are not
 part of the Notification Service, such as event channel federations, event
 correlation, suspension and resumption of consumer connections, and integration
 with a scheduling service. </p><p> The RT Event Service is older and perhaps more "mature" in that
 it has been through multiple iterations of development and is in active use
 by many real world applications.  However, the Notification Service is also
 quite good and since the Notification Service is based on an OMG specification,
 it may be a better choice for your application, depending upon your needs.
