Q: How do I get a TAO server to use IIOP v1.0 or v1.1?

A: You must
use the -ORBListenEndpoints option.  For further details, please refer to the <em>TAO
Developer's Guide</em>, the chapter on "ORB Initialization Options." Alternately
refer to $TAO_ROOT/docs/Options.html. <p>
The short answer is:
</p><p>
-ORBListenEndpoints iiop://V.v@[hostname:[port]]
</p><p> The V.v@ portion of this syntax informs the server to use a specific
major and minor version of the specified protocol.  For example, to force
a server to use IIOP v1.1 (instead of the default v1.2) on a host named "barney"
at port 22000: </p><p>
-ORBListenEndpoints iiop://1.1@barney:22000
</p><p> If you always want to force use of IIOP 1.0 or 1.1, you can set the
following macro values and rebuild TAO (and your application): </p><p>
#define TAO_DEF_GIOP_MAJOR 1<br>
#define TAO_DEF_GIOP_MINOR 0  [or 1]
</p><p>
These macros are typically set in $TAO_ROOT/tao/orbconf.h or $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h.
<br>Correction to the "-ORBListenEndpoints" syntax.  It should be:<br>
-ORBListenEndpoints iiop://1.0@[host][:port]<br>
The hostname is not always required.
