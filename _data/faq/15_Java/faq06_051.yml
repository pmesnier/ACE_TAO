Q: How can I use TAO's Naming Service with my Java ORB?

A: When I use the TAO name service, JavaORB returns an org.omg.CORBA.INV_OBJREF
in resolve_initial_references("NameService").
<p>
There's a file called NS_Resolve.java in<br>
</p><pre>    $TAO_ROOT/examples/Simulator/DOVEBrowser<br></pre> that contains
code which discovers TAO's Naming Service via the multicast discovery mechanism.
 Hooking that into the initial references table is ORB-specific, however. 
<p> Alternately, you can bypass the TAO Naming Service's multicast mechanism
and connect your Java application to it directly.  For an example which uses
TAO and JacORB, see LINK:074:
