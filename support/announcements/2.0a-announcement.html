	<h1>TAO 2.0a Release Announcement</h1>







	<p>ACE+TAO 2.0a is now available for download.&nbsp; Please see
<a href="http://download.ociweb.com/TAO-2.0a"> http://download.ociweb.com/TAO-2.0a</a> for the download.
Our sincere thanks to the large community of ACE+TAO users and
contributors, without whom this release would not have been possible.
</p><p>TAO 2.0a derives from the DOC TAO 2.0.4 micro kit with bugfix-related
patches selectively applied to enhance stability. A record of applied
patches can be found in OCIChangeLog files installed with the
distribution.
</p><p>Many important new features and bug fixes have been introduced in TAO
2.0a. They are described briefly here. These and many other features of
TAO 2.0a are detailed in OCI's TAO Developer's Guide, Version 2.0a,
which will be available separately.
For a detailed description of the motivation for and implementation of
a particular change, see the appropriate OCIChangeLog or ChangeLog file
in the TAO 2.0a source code distribution, such as
ACE_wrappers/OCIChangeLog, ACE_wrappers/TAO/OCIChangeLog,
ACE_wrappers/TAO/CIAO/OCIChangeLog and
ACE_wrappers/TAO/DAnCE/OCIChangeLog.
Some ChangeLog entries may include a "ticket" number (e.g., [RT
12345]), to help customers track specific changes they have sponsored.
</p><p><b>Features added since TAO 1.6a</b>
</p><p>Many features have been added to ACE and TAO since the release of TAO
1.6a. A comprehensive listing is available in the NEWS files of each of
the major package root directories. See in particular summaries from the
top of the file down to the x.6.7 release.
</p><p>The following list provides some highlights.
</p><ul><li>Added build support for the Android native development environment. <br /></li><li>Many performance improvements to the TAO core libraries. <br /></li><li>Improved support for the use of mt_noupcall wait strategy. <br /></li><li>Improved performance of the Parallel Connect Strategy. <br /></li><li>Improved Unicode compatibility, including WinCE support. <br /></li><li>Improved service configuration processing. <br /></li><li>Updated ZIOP to match the OMG Beta 2 specification. <br /></li><li>Sequences can now optionally check to see if an element request is
  beyond the length of the sequence. When encountered, a BAD_PARAM
  exception is raised. This is enabled by default in debug builds, and
  can be explicitly enabled by defining TAO_CHECKED_SEQUENCE_INDEXING in
  your ace/config.h file. <br /></li><li>New ORB initialization options added:
  -ORBHandleLoggingStrategyEvents
  -ORBIgnoreDefaultSvcConfFile
  -ORBForwardOnceOnObjectNotExist
  -ORBForwardOnceOnCommFailure
  -ORBForwardOnceOnTransient
  -ORBForwardOnceOnInvObjref
  See TAO/docs/options.html or the TAO Developer's Guide 2.0a for
  details about these new options.
- Deprecated configuration options removed:
  -ORBConnectionCachingStrategy
  -ORBObjectKeyTableLock
  -ORBPOALock <br /></li></ul><p>The IDL Compiler has undergone significant improvement since TAO 1.6a. Detail of these changes can be found in TAO/docs/compiler.html and in
  the TAO Developer's Guide 2.0a. Here are highlights of the changes:
  </p><ul><li>Added support for IDL3+ keywords. <br /></li><li>Improved the speed of processing large files with many module
    reopenings. <br /></li><li>Many changes to improve the support for generating CCM related
    files. <br /></li><li>Anonymous type use now triggers an error. This behavior can be
    modified by compiling with options described in docs/compiler.html. <br /></li><li>Added new command line option -iC to override the default include
    path for *C.h files included in generated *A.h files. <br /></li><li>Added code generation for export header files. <br /></li><li>Initial support for IDL-&gt;C++ mapping added, including support for
    std::string and std::vector use. <br /></li><li>Renamed ALL ORB service executables. There were many instances where
  services from multiple vendors were installed on the same host. Adding
  tao_ to the name of the service makes it unambiguous which vendor's
  service is being invoked. To see the full list, look at the changes
  between TAO-1.8.2 and TAO-1.8.3 in TAO/NEWS. <br /></li><li>The Naming service may now be run with multiple processing threads. <br /></li><li>Many improvements to the Notification service are available including: <br /></li><li>The Monitor/Control feature now works in static builds. <br /></li><li>The Monitor nw reports queue-overflow and has improved reporting of
    queue depth. <br /></li><li>Codeset negotiation support in the notification service is now a
    compile-time option. <br /></li><li>The -ORBRunThreads option is now called -RUNThreads. <br /></li><li>The clean up of proxies when a peer dies has been improved. <br /></li><li>Topology persistence now includes persisting filters. <br /></li><li>Improved the Implementation repository performance
- Added a new utility, tao_logWalker to assist with the diagnosis of
  problems that may span many processes in a distributed system. <br /></li></ul><p><b>Important bug fixes since TAO 1.6a</b>
</p><p>Many bugs have been fixed or work-arounds provided since TAO 1.6a. For
more details, see the release announcements for the intervening DOC

    "c:\Project Files\..." or "c:\Documents and Settings\.." etc. <br /></li><li>Fixed bug in code generation for components, where a derived
    component or home with more than one generation of ancestors was
