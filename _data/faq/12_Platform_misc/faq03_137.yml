Q: What issues are involved when using MFC  with ACE/TAO?

A: >
 You can add an ACE_HAS_MFC conditional #define to your ace/config.h file.<br>
  It is only necessary to use ACE_HAS_MFC if you wish threads created and
  managed by ACE to be able to make MFC calls. The ACE_HAS_MFC setting causes
  ACE to use CWinThread worker thread objects for all threads. ACE will still
  manage these threads just the same as threads created by _beginthreadex().
  The only difference is the extra thread-local data stored in the threads.
  Refer to the many articles on MSDN for when to use AfxBeginThread vs  _beginthread,
 and which MFC functions require CWinThreads. There are quite a few subtle
 problems. For instance, you typically can't use an MFC wrapper  object created
 in one thread in another. (By wrapper object, I mean those  that wrap windows
 handles. CDC, CWnd, ...) (The typical solution is to pass  the handles betweeen
 threads.) --- In summary, if you find that you really do need to make MFC
 calls from ACE  threads then use the MFC build of the ACE library, however
 it is typically not necessary because the layer of software using ACE/TAO
 is often separated from the layer using MFC.  <br>
