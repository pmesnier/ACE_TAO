Q: Why does my TAO application leak memory when using Windows threads? 
A: >
 On Windows, if one spawns a thread with, for example
 <code>_beginthreadex</code>, and makes CORBA calls from that thread,
 TAO will leak memory.  TAO uses TSS (<em>thread specific storage</em>)
 for handling requests along the output data paths.  With Win32
 threads, the underlying type system does not invoke destructors on
 TSS and the application will leak memory.
 
 To get around this problem, please use ACE threads wherever possible.
