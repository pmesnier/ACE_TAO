Q: Why does ORB_init change the order of the command line arguments if we pass argv to ORB_init(argc, argv)?

A: >
 CORBA::ORB_init() is supposed to remove all "-ORB" options it recognizes.  One way of doing that logically and
 efficiently is to put all of those recognized arguments at the end of the argument vector and adjust the argument count (argc) accordingly.
 
 <p>You are only supposed to use the first "argc" number of arguments after call
 CORBA::ORB_init().  In your case, you had:
 <pre>
   argc = 3    and argv = { "ex", "-ORBDebugLevel", "5" }
 </pre>
 After calling CORBA::ORB_init() you have:
 <pre>
   argc = 1    and argv = { "ex", "5", "-ORBDebugLevel" }
 </pre>
 This means that you should only be using first argument from the argument vector.<br>
 <br>
 If you need to maintain the order of the original argument vector for later use,
 then you have to make a copy before calling CORBA::ORB_init().</p>
