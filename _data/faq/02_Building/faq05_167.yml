Q: GPERF is licensed as GPL2. Will that impact my application?

A: No. TAO_IDL simply "fork/execs" a gperf process to generate the hash
function, so it doesn't contain any GPL'd code internally, and hence is
not a derived work in the GPL sense. (Thanks to Doug Schmidt)

There are no other libraries in TAO that use GPERF code, nor any other 
GPL code. Neither is the generated code affected by the GPL.
