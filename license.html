    <h2>Licensing Terms:</h2><p><i>(Updated for TAO 2.2a)</i></p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3><p>TAO is made available under the "open source software" model. The source is freely downloadable, open for inspection, review and comment. Copies may be freely installed across all your systems and those of your customers. The source code is designed to be compiled and used across a wide variety of hardware and operating systems architectures. Target systems include UNIX systems, including Linux; MS Windows platforms, and real time platforms such as VxWorks, Integrity&nbsp;and LynxOS.</p>
    <p>The ACE ORB source code is copyrighted by Dr. Douglas C Schmidt and his research group at Washington University in St. Louis, University of California - Irvine and Vanderbilt University Copyright (c) 1993-2013, all rights reserved. The actual terms are given below, are also included in TAO documentation from OCI and the OCI distributions of TAO on CDs. TAO is made available by means of an open source model. TAO may be used without the payment of development license or run time fees. It also means that the TAO source may be made available along, with any added value products, which utilize TAO. The distributions on CD contain the source code for ACE and TAO, in accordance with those requirements.</p>
    <p>The TAO product suite now includes an ACE&nbsp;based&nbsp;implementation of the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS).&nbsp;Previously called TAO DDS, it is now known as OpenDDS. OpenDDS&nbsp;was developed by, and is copyrighted by OCI. DDS requires an ORB, (i.e. TAO) in order to function. OpenDDS is therefore made available under the same generous licensing terms as TAO. </p>
    <p>TAO also includes software from Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle.) This software is related to the IDL compiler and IIOP. An open source build environment, MPC, is provided with TAO. MPC is copyrighted (2005-2013) by OCI. This software also may be freely distributed without fees. The licensing details are included below.</p>
    <p>TAO under certain circumstances also uses a software program called GPERF. This software was also written by Dr. Schmidt and is licensed under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU Public License (GPL). Details on this licensing may also be found below.</p>
    <p>Please read the licensing information prior to purchase if you have any concerns and to fully understand your obligations as a user.</p>
    <h3><a name="ACETAO">Copyright and Licensing Information for ACE<sup>(TM)</sup> and TAO<sup>(TM)</sup></a></h3><p>The ACE ORB source code is copyrighted by Dr. Douglas C Schmidt his research group at Washington University, University of California - Irvine and Vanderbilt University. The actual terms are also reproduced on the CD where available. TAO is made available by means of an open source model. TAO may be used without the payment of development license or run time fees. TAO source code may be made available along, with any added value products, which utilize TAO. This distribution contains not only the source code for ACE and TAO, in consonance with the spirit of open source practices, but also added value products such as installation scripts, object code for debugging and binaries for commonly used platforms. These are referred to as the software programs. OCI is the authorized distributor of TAO products and services. The use of the ACE, The ACE ORB and TAO trade or service marks is by permission of Washington University.</p>
    <h4>Warranty</h4><p>ACE and TAO are provided as is, with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Moreover, ACE and TAO are provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of Washington University,Vanderbilt University, its employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement.</p>
    <h4>Year 2000</h4><p>Both ACE and TAO have been designed to be Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant.</p>
    <h4>Liability</h4><p>Washington University, Vanderbilt University, its employees, and students shall have no liability with respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by ACE and TAO or any part thereof.

    <h3><a name="GPERF">Copyright and Licensing Information for GPERF</a></h3><p>GPERF is a standalone software program. GPERF generates perfect hash functions for lookups based on a set of key words when the key words are known in advance. They are called perfect hash functions because only a single access into the data structure is needed in order to perform a lookup. When the set of IDL operations is known in advanced TAO uses the perfect hash functions generated by GPERF in order to perform the operation lookup in constant time. Similarly servant lookups can be done, if the set of servants is known in advanced.</p>
    <p>GPERF was originally developed by Professor Douglas Schmidt. Professor Schmidt subsequently signed the copyright over to the Free Software Foundation, causing gperf to be licensed under the GPL (GNU General Public License). The FSF still maintains that version of gperf. When perfect hashing was added as an option to TAO, gperf was selected to provide that function. It was extended and enhanced to meet the more demanding needs of TAO and a derived version was placed in the ACE application libraries. When using TAO under certain circumstances you may elect to use that version of gperf, which is part of the ACE distribution of examples and optional programs. Both the current FSF gperf and the ACE gperf are based on the original implementation. Since the ACE gperf is derived from the original GPL'ed version, it too is licensed under the GPL.</p>

    <p>MPC (Make, Project and workspace Creator) is an open source tool, developed by OCI and written in Perl. It is designed to generate a variety of tool specific project files from a common baseline. Through the powerful combination of inheritance and defaults MPC is able to reduce the maintenance burden normally associated with keeping multiple target platforms, their unique build tools, and inconsistent feature sets current. It is also easily extensible to support new build environments. The objective is to solve the prevalent problem of fragile build environments usually experienced by developer group by replacing it with a singular robust build environment, and an active community of users committed to its evolution.</p>
    <p>Since MPC is open source and free of licensing fees, you are free to use, modify, and distribute the source code, as long as you include this copyright statement.</p>
    <p>In particular, you can use MPC to build proprietary software and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using MPC. Note, however, that you may not do anything to the MPC code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the MPC code, that will prevent MPC from being distributed freely using an open source development model.</p>
