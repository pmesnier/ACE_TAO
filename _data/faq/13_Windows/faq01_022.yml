Q: Does OCI's version of TAO contain MFC libraries?

A:
<p>
<em>MFC Libraries</em> are libraries built with the ACE_HAS_MFC variable
defined.  See LINK:137: for more details of what this means.
</p>
<p>
The OCI-produced binary installation kits  do not contain MFC libraries for Windows platforms.
You will need to recompile ACE and TAO in order to build them with MFC libraries.
