Q: Why don't signals work with the ORB's reactor? 

A: >
 Signals and the ORB reactor:<br>
 <p>
 By default ACE uses the ACE_Select reactor, which works with
 signals. TAO defaults to use the thread pool (TP) reactor, which does
 not currently work with signals.  See DOC Bug 1031:<br><br>

 </p>
 
 <p>
 The call <code>ACE_Reactor::instance()</code> returns an ACE_Select_Reactor.
 The call <code>TAO_ORB_Core_instance()->reactor()</code> returns an
 ACE_TP_Reactor.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Another possible approach for handling signals in a TAO
 application that uses the default TP reactor would be to 
 spawn a separate thread and use <code>ACE_OS::sigwait()</code> to handle the signals.
