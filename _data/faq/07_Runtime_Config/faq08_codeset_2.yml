Q: I'm not interested in using Codeset Negotiation, how can I disable it?
A: You may disable the codeset negotiation feature completely by passing
-ORBNegotiateCodesets 0 to ORB_init. When this is done, the TAO_Codeset library
is not loaded, thus saving the memory and messaging overhead of codeset
negotiation.
<p>
TAO may also be built with codeset negotiation off by default. This is done by
editing ACE_wrappers/ace/config.h and adding
<br>
<code>#define TAO_NEGOTIATE_CODESETS 0</code>
<p>
This will set the internal default to not load the codeset library, but this
can be overridden by supplying -ORBNegotiateCodesets 1 to ORB_init.
