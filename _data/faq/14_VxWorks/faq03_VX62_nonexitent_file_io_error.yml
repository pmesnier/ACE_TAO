Q: "On VxWorks 6.2 upon execution I see the following error message \"ERROR: input in scanner failed \"?"
A: >
 This message indicates that the service configurator failed to read the configuration file for some reason. On
    VxWorks 6.2 we have seen this message because of a bug in the NFS V2 driver wherein the driver returns
    a corrupt file handle when opening a non-existent file. If a config file hasn't been specified, the
    service configurator tries to open the default config file 'svc.conf'. Trying then to read in from the
    returned corrupt file handle results in the above message.
 
    <p>This issue is documented in defect #55808. A fix for this is documented this whcih requires a kernel
    rebuild. A quick work around is to create a dummy svc.conf file. Another workaround is LINK:disregard_default_svc_conf:.
