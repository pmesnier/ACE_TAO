Q: Why is the TAOd.dll library I install from OCI's CD so large?

A: >
 The DLLs
 on the CD include all the information you need to debug TAO applications.
  This information is normally stored by Visual C++ in .pdb files.  Our builds
 store them in the .dll in a location independent manner (using the C7 compatible
 option for the debug information).  This allows you to step into TAO code
 in the Visual C++ debugger. <p> If you desire a smaller set of libraries, either install the release
 versions of the CD or rebuild the debug libraries with the default debug
 configuration.<br>
