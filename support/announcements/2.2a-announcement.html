	<h1>TAO 2.2a Release Announcement</h1>







	<p>ACE+TAO 2.2a is now available for download.&nbsp; Please see
<a href="http://download.ociweb.com/TAO-2.2a"> http://download.ociweb.com/TAO-2.2a</a> for the download.
Our sincere thanks to the large community of ACE+TAO users and
contributors, without whom this release would not have been possible.
</p><p>TAO 2.2a derives from the DOC TAO 2.2.0 micro kit with bugfix-related
patches selectively applied to enhance stability. A record of applied
patches can be found in OCIChangeLog files installed with the
distribution.
</p><p>Many important new features and bug fixes have been introduced in TAO
2.2a. They are described briefly here. These and many other features of
TAO 2.2a are detailed in OCI's TAO Developer's Guide, Version 2.2a,
which will be available separately.
For a detailed description of the motivation for and implementation of
a particular change, see the appropriate OCIChangeLog or ChangeLog file
in the TAO 2.2a source code distribution, such as
ACE_wrappers/OCIChangeLog, ACE_wrappers/TAO/OCIChangeLog,
ACE_wrappers/TAO/CIAO/OCIChangeLog and
ACE_wrappers/TAO/DAnCE/OCIChangeLog.
Some ChangeLog entries may include a "ticket" number (e.g., [RT
12345]), to help customers track specific changes they have sponsored.
</p><p><b>Features added since TAO 2.2a</b>
</p><p>Many features have been added to ACE and TAO since the release of TAO
2.0a. A comprehensive listing is available in the NEWS files of each of
the major package root directories. See in particular summaries from the
top of the file down to the x.0.4 release.
</p><p>The following list provides some highlights.
</p>
<UL>
  <LI>Many performance improvements to the ACE/TAO core libraries.
    <UL>
      <LI>Generated skeleton code presents a smaller footprint, saving between 10 and 60% depending on use.</LI>
       <LI>There is now a TIME_POLICY strategy manager allowing for dynamic selection of either system time or highres time</LI>
       <LI>ZIOP compressed data performance is improved</LI>
       <LI>Generated ValueType OBV_* classes now provide a _copy_value() hook method for better duplication support.</LI>
       <LI>Multiple retries on invocation failures is now configurable. This works in conjunction with fault tolerant services to allow for transparent selection of the backup server if the primary fails</LI>
       <LI>Improved MIOP implementation to support message fragmentation.</LI>
       <LI>Added OpenSSL configuration options SSLCipherList and SSLServerCipherOrder to the SSLIOP_Factory. This allows the SSL/TLS BEAST exploit to be mitigated.</LI>
       <LI>Extended CosNotifyFilter::FilterFactory to allow removal of filters created by the factory.</LI>
     </UL>
   </LI>
   <LI>A new Dynamic Thread Pool is available for non-RT ORBs and POAs. This allows for automatic spawning of threads at runtime to some configured maximum as well as the destruction of spawned threads as load is reduced. Multiple thread pool definitions can be supplied via service configuration directives, then used by the ORB or POA. POAs may also be supplied dynamic thread pool configuration through new policy objects. Dynamic thread pools may be configured with a minimum and maximum thread counts, and an idle timeout. WHen the configured ORB or POA is activated, the minimum number of threads are spawned. The thread pool grows to the maximum count as load increases, then shrinks back to the minimum as threads sit idle. POA thread pools also accept a configurable message queue limit, above which requests are rejected.</LI>
   <LI>The Naming Service and Implementation repository are now Fult Tolerant, supporting a dual-redundant configuration which provides replication and seamless failover between primary and back up servers.</LI>
   <LI>Fault Tolerance is available for Naming and Implementation Repository services. This makes use of shared persistent state and communication between a primary and backup instance. CLients make use of automatic retry to switch from a failed primary to a back up server without application intervention.</LI>
   <LI>Implementation Repository now uses asynchronous messaging to improve efficiency under heavy use conditions.</LI>
   <LI>Implementation Repository is now able to register and launch JacORB servers. Requires JacORB 3.3 or later</LI>
   <LI>New ORB initialization arguments:
     <UL>
       <LI>-ORBForwardOn<I>Exception</I>Limit <I>count</I> supercedes -ORBForwardOnceOn<I>Exception</I> to accept a count of retries. <I>Exception</I> in this case is CommFail, Transient, ObjectNotExist, InvObjref, ReplyClosed</LI>
       <LI>-ORBForwardDelay <I>msecs</I></LI>
       <LI>-ORBDynamicThreadPoolName <I>name</I></LI>
     </UL>
   </LI>
   <LI>New Client Strategy Factory options:
     <UL>
       <LI>Client strategies -ORBWaitStrategy RW and -ORBTransportMuxStrategy Exclusive now work with AMI</LI>
       <LI>-ORBCollocationStrategy best selects the best available strategy.</LI>
     </UL>
   </LI>
   <LI>Other factory options
     <UL>
       <LI>UIPMC transport -ORBPreferredInterfaces, -ORBListenOnAll</LI>
       <LI>MIOP transport -ORBSendThrottling and -ORBEagerDequeueing</LI>
     </UL>
     See TAO/docs/options.html or the TAO Developer's Guide 2.2a for details about these new options.</LI>
   <LI>IDL Compiler Improvments:
     <UL>
       <LI>Fixed a bug related to compnent initialization.</LI>
       <LI>Fixed a bug related to processing multiple files in a single execution.</LI>
     </UL>
   </LI>
 </UL>
