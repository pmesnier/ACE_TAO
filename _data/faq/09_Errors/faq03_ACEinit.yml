Q: Why I am getting errors when I try to initialize the first ACE    object in an application?

A: >
 The short answer is that you probably need to call <code>ACE::init()</code>
    before initializing or using any ACE/TAO objects.
    You should also be sure to call
    <code>ACE::fini()</code> at the end of your application's
    use of ACE.
 
 <p>
   When you include ACE/TAO headers from the file containing
   the <code>main()</code> function, the <code>ACE::init()</code>
   function is called automatically for you at the start of
   <code>main()</code>.  <code>ACE::init()</code> initializes
   the ACE Object Manager, and must be called before
   initializing or using any ACE/TAO objects.  When you only use ACE/TAO from
   libraries that are dynamically linked, you may need to
   explicitly call <code>ACE::init()</code> beforehand.  Also,
   you will need to call <code>ACE::fini()</code> to close down
   the ACE Object Manager at the end of your application's use
   of ACE/TAO (e.g., at an exit point from the code in your library).
