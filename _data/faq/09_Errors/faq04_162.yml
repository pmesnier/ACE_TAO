Q: Why is my application leaking memory when I use local objects?

A: It is likely that your objects are using reference counting to manage
their life cycle.  The CORBA::LocalObject class provides an empty
implementation of the _add_ref() and _remove_ref() methods.  However, the
TAO_Local_RefCounted_Object implements real reference counting through these
methods.

The solution to your memory leak may be as simple as inheriting from
TAO_Local_RefCounted_Object instead of CORBA::LocalObject.
