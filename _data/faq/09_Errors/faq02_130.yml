Q: My server IOR contains the address 127.0.0.1 and my client, running on a different machine, can't connect.  What do I do?

A: >
 When determining
 the endpoint for a server, TAO chooses an interface from the interfaces available
 to the system and encodes its address within the IOR.  If TAO chooses 127.0.0.1
 (the local loop back) as the endpoint address, then it could not find any
 other suitable interfaces.  Since this address is only visible to local machine,
 no other machine will be able to connect to the local machine through that
 address.<br> If there are dynamic interfaces that are available to the system,
 you may need to explicitly specify that TAO should use that interface with
 the -ORBListenEndpoints command line option:<br>
 <pre>  -ORBListenEndpoints iiop://&lt; hostname or ip address &gt;:&lt; port &gt;<br></pre>
 <br>
