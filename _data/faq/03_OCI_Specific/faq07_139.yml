Q: How do I get support from OCI?

A: <!-- This text is untranslated from the original;

 You're always welcome to send a question.  However, the disposition of your
request depends upon whether or not you have a technical support contract
with OCI:  <ul>
<li>
<b>If you have a technical support contract with OCI,
someone</b> will begin addressing the issue and <b>will follow
up with you according to the provisions outlined in your
support contract.</b>

</li><li>
<b>If you do <em>not</em> have a technical support contract with OCI,</b>
someone will still review the support request and may get
back to you, but <b>we cannot guarantee that we will have
time to work on the problem without a support contract.</b>
</li></ul>
