Q: Why can't I make an SSLIOP connection using a DSA certificate?

A: >
 If you would like to create and use DSA certificates there are a couple of things that need 
 to be done for it to work with SSLIOP. When using DSA certificates you need to specify DH parameters. 
 You can do this by obtaining the SSL context before any connections are made using the ORB. 
 This is TAO specific therefore not portable to other ORBs. First you need to obtain a set of DH parameters. 
 You can either generate these at runtime ( which will take a very long time ), 
 or generate them once with the openssl tool and append them to the end of your certificate. <br>
 <pre>  openssl tool: [Command Line]
        openssl gendh 512 &gt;&gt;cert.pem<br></pre>
 This will add 512-bit DH parameters to the end of the file cert.pem. 
 After you have created these parameters you will need to load them in your application.<br>
 <pre>  #include "orbsvcs/SSLIOPC.h"
   #include "openssl/pem.h"<br>
   // Open the file with the DH parameters
   FILE * fp = fopen ( "cert.pem", "r" );<br>
   // Read in the DH parameters from the open file
   DH * dh_params = PEM_read_DHparams ( fp , NULL, NULL, NULL );<br>
   // Obtain the SSL Context so we can set the DH parameters for it
   SSL_CTX * ssl_ctx = ACE_SSL_Context::instance()-&gt;context();<br>
   // Set the DH Parameters for the SSL Context
   SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh ( ssl_ctx , dh_params );<br></pre>
 This should be it. This sets the DH parameters needed to use a DSA certificate with SSLIOP. 
 Please note that a greater degree of error checking should be done than what is provided in this code.
