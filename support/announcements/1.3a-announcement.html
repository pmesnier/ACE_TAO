<h2>OCI is pleased to announce the availability of TAO 1.3a!</h2>


<p>OCI's TAO 1.3a release is based on the DOC (see<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-group.html">
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-group.html</a>) group's TAO 1.3.1 beta kit. OCI has performed extensive testing of TAO across a wide variety of platforms and added several enhancements, some of which were funded by our customers.<br>
<br>
TAO 1.3a includes many new features and improvements over the previous commercially supported (TAO 1.2a) release and has been extensively tested across a wide variety of platforms (over 11,000 tests run on 40 hardware/compiler combinations) to increase availability and stability. Some of the more important and visible new features of TAO 1.3a include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Addition of Persistent State Service (PSS).</li>
  <li>Addition of Load Balancing Service that implements the current joint load-balancing submission revision of the OMG.</li>

  <li>New Logging Service, also known as the OMG Telcom Log Service.</li>
  <li>TAO's MIOP support enables servants to receive requests sent to multicast addresses.</li>
  <li>New Unreliable IP Multicast (UIPMC) pluggable protocol.</li>
  <li>New XML Parser for the Service Configurator.</li>
  <li>ACE has been ported to Windows CE 3 with Pocket PC 2002 SDK, and Windows CE .NET with Standard SDK complete.</li>
  <li>AIX and HP-UX can now use g++ 3.2 (previous versions of g++ were not reliable on these platforms).</li>

  <li>The conversion of ACE/TAO documentation to Doxygen has been completed.</li>
  <li>Addition of MakeProjectCreator (MPC), a powerful tool that can be used to generate build tool specific project files from a generic
    &quot;mpc&quot; file.</li>
  <li>Addition of Redundant Naming Service.</li>
  <li>Shared source on Windows.</li>
  <li>Overhaul of input stream processing.</li>
