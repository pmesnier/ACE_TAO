Q: How can I help extend TAO's functionality and add new features?

A: TAO is open source and the development group welcomes code contributions.
Active participation by users ensures a robust implementation.  Please refer to
the terms and conditions relating to software submissions in
the ACE, TAO, CIAO, and CoSMIC copyright and licensing
information:
<a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE-copying.html">http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-copying.html</a>.
In general, incorporation of your code into TAO results in it becoming "open" and the user
community being protected by the ACE/TAO copyright and terms.
<p>
OCI can also provide consulting and software engineering resources to help you
add new functionality into TAO or to span additional platforms.  We can also
manage the inclusion of such code into the supported releases of new open
source versions of TAO.  We can provide anonymity if you wish to avoid exposing
your technical strategies in public forums, where your competition may be
watching.  Contact <a href="mailto:sales@ociweb.com?subject=TAO%20FAQ%20%28maintained%20by%20OCI%20for%20the%20TAO%20Community%29">sales@ociweb.com</a> to discuss your project.
</p><p> Open source software can add immeasurably to the development of a
rich infrastructure, and the provision of a high degree of application  
            interoperability, from which we all may derive benefit.  Read
