Q: My platform doesn't have a filesystem; how can I use service configurator directives?

A: >
 Many embedded
 systems don't have filesystems, which really puts a cramp in using the <code>svc.conf</code>
 file and its directives (e.g., for the <code>Resource_Factory</code>). <p> However, you can pass Service Configurator directives on the "command
 line" using the <code>-ORBSvcConfDirective</code> (Section 7.4 in the <em>TAO Developer's
 Guide</em>). </p><p>
 For example, you might put code like the following in your main():<br>
 </p><pre>
   ACE_ARGV orb_args(
     "-ORBSvcConfDirective "
     "\"static Resource_Factory '-ORBResources tss'\"");
   CORBA::ORB_var orb = CORBA::ORB_init(orb_args->argc(),
                                        orb_args->argv());
 </pre>
 <br>
