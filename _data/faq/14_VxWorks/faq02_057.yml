Q: How do I create shared libraries?

A: >
 Shared
 libraries on VxWorks aren't really shared libraries.  If you ever worked
 on Unix in the days before shared libraries, you might remember "relocatable
 object files", i.e., object files created by the linker with many of their
 symbols resolved, but also permitted to have unresolved symbols. <p>
 When you see <b>libACE.so</b> on VxWorks, they're simply relocatable object files.
 Once you realize that, and all it entails, your life will get easier :-)
 </p><p>
 Some implications of this are:
 </p><ul>
 <li>You should <b>not</b> use "-lACE" when linking libTAO.so, then try to
 load both libACE.so and libTAO.so.  This will lead to duplicate symbols because
 the creation of libTAO.so will resolve all the ACE symbols.  Thus, when you
 load libTAO.so after having loaded libACE.so, you will, effectively, load
 all the symbols in libACE.so again (they're in libTAO.so, too). </li><li>Similar to the previous point, you should not link libACE.so or libTAO.so into your application.
 </li></ul>
 
 A command line to create a shared library on VxWorks might look like:
 <pre>  $ make shared_libs_only=1 ACE_SHLIBS=
 </pre> The ACE_SHLIBS make macro usually contains the names of shared libraries
 to link in, such as "-lTAO -lACE", etc.  By making it empty, these do not
 get linked.  <br>
