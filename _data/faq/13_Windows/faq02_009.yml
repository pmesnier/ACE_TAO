Q: Why do I encounter linking errors when building Debug applications in Windows with Visual C++?

A: If you're linking debug versions of an executable or DLL and have unresolved symbols, there are several possible reasons:<br>
<ol>
<li> Is your library path correct?<br>
     (Check Tools|Options|Directories|Libraries or your project settings.)<br>
<li> Are you linking in the ACE, TAO, and possibly orbsvcs libraries?<br>
     (Check Build|Settings|Link)<br>
<li> Are you linking with the right library names?<br>
     If you are building your application against a Debug configuration
     of ACE+TAO, the names of the libraries will have the letter "d"
     in them (e.g., aced.lib, TAOd.lib, CosNamingd.lib).  If you are
     using a Release configuration of ACE+TAO, the "d" will not be
     present in the library names.<br>
<li> Have you installed or built the Debug configuration of ACE+TAO?<br>
     If you have only installed the non-Debug version of TAO, you will not
     be able to build Debug executables.  To check this, do one of the
     following:<ol>
       <li> Build the Release configuration of the executable; or
       <li> Remove _DEBUG from the list of preprocessor definitions.
     </ol>
     If the build succeeds, then you probably have a non-Debug version of
     TAO.<br>
</ol>
