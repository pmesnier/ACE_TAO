	  <li class="l2"><a name="heritage"></a><span class="l2">Heritage--Relationship to
	  DOC Releases</span>
	    <p>
	      TAO 1.1a derives from the DOC 1.1.4 beta kit with bugfix-related patches
	      selectively applied to enhance stability.  A record of applied patches can
	      be found in <a
	      href="http://www.theaceorb.com/11a/changelog/OCIChangeLog">OCIChangeLog</a> files
	      installed with the distribution.  At the time of this release, the current
	      DOC beta kit is 1.1.10.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="cdformat"></a><span class="l2">CD Format</span>
	    <p>
	      This CD's format is ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge and Joliet extensions.  Thus, it
	      should be readable on nearly every Unix platform (Rock Ridge extensions) as
	      well as Windows (Joliet extensions).  We mastered it using the freely-available <a
	      href="http://www.ps.ucl.ac.uk/~jcpearso/mkhybrid.html">mkhybrid</a> tool, and
	      recorded it using the freely-available <a
	      href="ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/">cdrecord</a>.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="gnumake"></a><span class="l2">GNU Make Required on Unix</span>
	    <p>
	      With the exception of Windows operating systems,
	      building ACE and TAO from source code requires GNU Make.  While you can use
	      other tools to build applications using ACE &amp; TAO, using GNU Make lets
	      you leverage the existing build system distributed with ACE &amp; TAO.  If
	      you need GNU Make, you can get a source distribution <a
	      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">here</a>
	      as well as other places.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="install_nt_on_nt"></a><span class="l2">Installing on Windows vs. UNIX</span>
	    <p>
              To install a Windows build of TAO 1.1a from CD, run
              setup on a Windows platform.  Likewise, to install for
              a UNIX or UNIX-like platform, run setup on a UNIX or
              UNIX-like platform. 
	    <p>

          <li class="l2"><a name="event_svc_clarification"></a><span class="l2">Clarification of Event Service Installation Nomenclature</span></li>
            <p>
              During installation, a dialog will ask you to select the
              service executables you wish to install.  The dialog
              lists two event service executables, and does not
              provide much help in discerning the difference.
            <p>
              Select <b>CosEvent</b> to install the service executable
              for the OMG's CosEvent service; select <b>Event</b> to
              install the service executable for TAO's Real-Time Event
              service (RTEC).

	<ol type="a">
	  <li class="l2"><a name="giop"></a><span class="l2">GIOP 1.2</span>
	    <p>
	    TAO 1.1a includes support not only for GIOP 1.0 and GIOP 1.1, but also most of
	    GIOP 1.2.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="services"></a><span class="l2">New Services</span>
	    <p>
	    Several services were added including Concurrency Control,
	    Load Balancing, Logging and Notification.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="corba23"></a><span class="l2">Compliance directed
	  towards CORBA 2.3</span>
	    <p>
	    The TAO 1.1a release targets compliance with the CORBA 2.3 Specification, whereas TAO
	    1.0a targeted compliance with the CORBA 2.2 specification.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="ins"></a><span class="l2">Interoperable Naming
	  Service</span>
	    <p>
	    TAO 1.1a includes an implementation of the Interoperable Naming Service (INS).
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="messaging"></a><span class="l2">CORBA Messaging
	  Support</span>
	    <p>
	    TAO 1.1a includes support for Asynchronous Method Invocation and
	    a subset of the QoS policies of the CORBA Messaging Specification.
	    <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="rtcorba"></a><span class="l2">Real-time CORBA Support</span>
	    <p> TAO 1.1a includes in-progress support for the

                Using the <code>-j</code> for GNU Make can cause

                specified in the Makefile.

                Both Sun Workshop 5.0 and 5.1/Forte require
                <em>explicit template instantiation</em> and <em>do
                not support function inlining</em>.  These settings
                are enforced by the <code>platform_*</code> files for
                these compilers, and will override any setting to the
                contrary in <em>your</em>
                <code>platform_macros.GNU</code>.  Also, the "old"
                <code>iostreams</code> library is used rather than the
                "new" one.

                For some reason the Installer's window looks weird
                when using Big Fonts under Windows.  The simple
                workaround is to resize the window to redraw and make
                it look sane.

                The ACE <code>Process_Manager_Test</code> fails when
                compiled multi-threaded (i.e., using the <em>-mt</em>
                option for SunCC or <em>-D_REENTRANT</em> linked with
                <em>-lthread</em> for gcc) on SunOS 5.6-5.8.  This is
                <em>not</em> a bug in ACE, but rather a bug in
                Solaris' thread implementation.  The bug is documented
                in the <code>setitimer(2)</code> manual page, and
                relates to the disposition of <code>SIGALRM</code> in
                the face of multiple threads.  There is no known
                workaround for this problem.

              <dd>
                This problem cuts across platforms and tests; we've
                seen it happen on SunOS 5.6 as well as on NT.  On
                Solaris, it predominantly occurs in the
                <em>Latency</em> performance test and in the
                <em>MT_Client</em> test.  On NT, it consistently fails
                <em>Latency</em> as well as occasional failures of
                <em>MT_Client</em>, <em>EndPoint_Per_Priority</em>,
                and <em>Leader_Followers</em>.
                <p>

                  discussed on tao-users</a> several times, and the
                  only workaround/explanation is to run the server
                  using <code>-ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1</code>.
                  The best guess is that it's related to delays during
                  name-to-address resolution.

              <p>
              <dd>
                The ACE <code>CDR_Array_Test</code> fails to link when
                compiled with compilers using implicit template
                instantiation.  We discovered this using the Sun
                Workshop 4.2 compiler/linker where we got the

                </pre>
This problem does <em>not</em> occur using explicit template instantiation.
<p>
The linkage failure is caused by a template's code referencing a
static array declared in file scope.  For the case of explicit
template instantiation, this is okay because the instantiations remain
in the same compilation/linkage unit as the static array.  However,
for implicit instantiation, the templates and the static array exist
in separate compilation units, and standard linker rules do not permit
visibility of the static array from the template instantiation.
<p>
At the time of this release, this failure's been fixed in DOC Beta kit
1.1.10 by moving the static array into the template itself.

              <p>
              <dd>
The automated tests included with TAO do not fully support this platform and this resulted in a number of test failures beyond those seen on Windows NT.  Some of these tests fail because they use features that Windows 98 does not support, others fail because the tests run too slowly and time-out, and still others fail because of problems in the test automation framework specific to Windows 98.  These failures should not affect the basic functionality of TAO (and your applications).

      <li class="l1"><a name="building_apps"></a><span class="l1">Quickstart for Building with TAO</span>

	<p> This section contains a few things you will need to know to build applications 
      which use the TAO and ACE libraries distributed on this CD. You can find 
      more detailed information in <a href="bldgapps.html">bldgapps.html</a>, 
      adapted from the <a
	  href="http://www.theaceorb.com/product/index.html"><em>TAO Developer's Guide</em> 
      (OCI part number 510-01)</a>, <a
	  href="https://ssl.ociweb.com/buy/index.html">available for purchase online</a>. 
    <p>

        <ol type="a">
	  <li class="l2"><a name="building_unix"></a><span class="l2">TAO on UNIX</span>

	    <p>
              On UNIX and UNIX-like systems, you should use GNU Make to build applications
              with TAO.  The document <a
              href="bldgapps.html#UNIX_Section">bldgapps.html</a> shows
              an <a href="bldgapps.html#makefileexample">example Makefile</a>.
            <p>
              Briefly, you will need to set the following environment variables:
            <p>

            <dl>
              <dt><code>ACE_ROOT</code></dt>
              <dd>The base of your ACE and TAO installation</dd>

              <dt><code>TAO_ROOT</code></dt>
              <dd><code>$ACE_ROOT/TAO</code></dd>

              <dt><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH (SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX)</code></dt>
              <dd>Must include <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
              These can all be set by "sourcing" the environment script located
              in your ACE_wrappers directory.
              For example, assuming the base of your installation of TAO is in
              <code>/usr/local/ACE_wrappers</code>, and assuming you are using the
              C-shell (csh):
            <p>
	      <div class="out">
source /usr/local/ACE_wrappers/ace_env.csh<br>
              </div>
              <em>Note: <code>ace_env.sh</code> is also supplied for Bourne-like Shell users</em>
            <p>

	  <li class="l2"><a name="building_nt"></a><span class="l2">TAO on Win32 with Visual C++</span>
            <p>
              To build applications with ACE/TAO the following environment variables need to be set:
            <p>

            <dl>
              <dt><code>ACE_ROOT</code></dt>
              <dd>The base of your ACE and TAO installation</dd>

              <dt><code>TAO_ROOT</code></dt>
              <dd><code>%ACE_ROOT%\TAO</code></dd>

              <dt><code>PATH</code></dt>
              <dd>Must include <code>%ACE_ROOT%\bin</code></dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              See <a href="bldgapps.html#Setting_UNIX_Env_Vars">bldgapps.html</a> for detailed instructions on setting the environment variables for the various Windows OSs.  On Windows NT and Windows 2000, the installer script sets the ACE_ROOT and TAO_ROOT environment variables, but you need to explicitly add the specified directory to the PATH variable.    You may need to log out and back in to actually see these variables propagated to all running processes.  On Windows 98, you need to explictly set all the variables listed above.
            <p>
              You also need to add various directories to the global Visual C++ settings so that VC++ can properly locate the ACE/TAO header files and libraries.  This is described in <a href="bldgapps.html#Setting_Visual_CPP_Options">bldgapps.html</a>.
            <p>
              Any existing Visual C++ projects that need to use TAO should be modified as described in <a href="bldgapps.html#createproject">bldgapps.html</a>.  Briefly, you need to:
            <ul>
              <li> Modify the default compiler settings to use
                   multi-threaded DLLs;
              <li> Modify the Input Object/Library modules to use the
                   debug or release versions of the ACE, TAO, and
                   orbsvcs libraries, as appropriate for your
                   development environment;
              <li> Set up a custom build configuration to invoke the TAO
                   IDL compiler to generate C++ header and source files
                   from OMG IDL files.
              </ul>

            <p>
              The CD includes a sample application which you can build and run to verify
              that your installation of TAO was successful.  The application consists of a
              simple message server and client.  The client sends a message to the
              server by invoking an operation on a Messenger object.
            <p>
              Source code for this application is found on the CD in the file
              <code>example.tgz</code>.  We have also included a Makefile for building the
              application on UNIX and UNIX-like systems, and a Visual C++ project file
              for building it on Windows.
            <p>
              On UNIX and UNIX-like platforms, use <code>gunzip</code> and
              <code>tar</code> to uncompress and unpack this file.  Then, run GNU Make in the
              example directory to build the MessengerServer and MessengerClient.  You can
              then run them after they are successfully built.
            <p>
              On Windows, use <code>WinZip</code> to unpack the file.  You will find a
              Visual C++ workspace called <code>GettingStartedVC</code> in the
              <code>example\GettingStartedVC</code> subdirectory which you can use to compile the
              interfaces and build the MessengerServer and MessengerClient programs.
            <p>
              The server creates a Messenger object and prints its IOR as a string to a file,
              then waits for client requests.  The client reads the IOR string from
              the file and sends a message using the Messenger object.  The server then prints
              the contents of the message to stdout.
            <p>
              Here is sample output from running the server and client on Linux:
            <p>

            <div class="out">
$ MessengerServer &<br>
